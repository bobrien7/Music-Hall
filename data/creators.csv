<p><b>Coldplay</b> are a British rock band formed in London in 1997. They consist of vocalist and pianist Chris Martin, guitarist Jonny Buckland, bassist Guy Berryman, drummer Will Champion and creative director Phil Harvey. They met at University College London and began playing music together from 1996 to 1998, initially calling themselves Starfish.
</p><p>After independently releasing an extended play, <i>Safety</i> (1998), Coldplay signed with Parlophone in 1999. The band's debut album, <i>Parachutes</i> (2000), included their breakthrough single ""Yellow"" and received a Brit Award for British Album of the Year, a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album and a Mercury Prize nomination. Their second album, <i>A Rush of Blood to the Head</i> (2002), won the same accolades and included the single ""Clocks"", which won a Grammy Award for Record of the Year. The band's third album, <i>X&amp;Y</i> (2005), which completed what the band considered to be a trilogy, and their fourth album, <i>Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends</i> (2008), were both nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Album, with the latter winning; both albums were the best-selling of their respective years, topping the charts in over 30 countries. <i>Viva la Vida</i> was also nominated for Album of the Year, while its title track became the first single by a British group to simultaneously reach number one in the United Kingdom and United States in the 21st century.
</p><p>Coldplay further diversified their sound over their next five studio albums, the most recent being <i>Music of the Spheres</i> (2021). Each album presented a unique theme and added new musical styles to the band's original repertoire, including electronica, ambient, pop, R&amp;B, classical and progressive rock. They are also known for ""euphoric"" and ""immersive"" live performances, which <i>NME</i> said are when the band ""come alive and make the most sense"". In 2018, a career-spanning documentary directed by Mat Whitecross was released in select cinemas to mark the band's 20th anniversary.
</p><p>With 100 million albums sold worldwide, Coldplay are one of the best-selling music acts of all time. According to Fuse, they are the sixth-most awarded group in history, which includes the most Brit Award nominations and wins for a band. Other notable achievements include the seventh-highest-grossing tour of all time, three of the 50 highest-selling albums in the United Kingdom, the most number-one albums in the country without ever missing the top, and becoming the first British group to debut at number one on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. Coldplay are considered one of the most influential bands of the 21st century, with <i>Forbes</i> describing them as the standard for the current alternative music scene. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame included <i>A Rush of Blood to the Head</i> on their ""200 Definitive Albums"" list and the single ""Yellow"" is part of their ""Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll"" exhibition for being one of the most successful and important recordings in the music industry. Despite their popularity and impact, Coldplay have earned a reputation as polarizing music icons.

<p><b>Radiohead</b> are an English rock band formed in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, in 1985. The band consists of Thom Yorke (vocals, guitar, piano, keyboards); brothers Jonny Greenwood (lead guitar, keyboards, other instruments) and Colin Greenwood (bass); Ed O'Brien (guitar, backing vocals); and Philip Selway (drums, percussion). They have worked with the producer Nigel Godrich and the cover artist Stanley Donwood since 1994. Radiohead's experimental approach is credited with advancing the sound of alternative rock.
</p><p>Radiohead signed to EMI in 1991 and released their debut album, <i>Pablo Honey,</i> in 1993; their debut single, ""Creep"", became a worldwide hit. Radiohead's popularity and critical standing rose with the release of <i>The Bends</i> in 1995. Radiohead's third album, <i>OK Computer</i> (1997), brought them international fame; noted for its complex production and themes of modern alienation, it is acclaimed as a landmark record and one of the best albums in popular music.
</p><p>Radiohead's fourth album, <i>Kid A</i> (2000), marked a dramatic change in style, incorporating influences from electronic music, jazz, classical music and krautrock. Though <i>Kid A</i> divided listeners, it later attracted wide acclaim. It was followed by <i>Amnesiac</i> (2001), recorded in the same sessions. <i>Hail to the Thief</i> (2003), with lyrics addressing the War on Terror, blended the band's rock and electronic sides, and was Radiohead's final album for EMI.
</p><p>Radiohead self-released their seventh album, <i>In Rainbows</i> (2007), as a download for which customers could set their own price, to critical and chart success. Their eighth album, <i>The King of Limbs</i> (2011), an exploration of rhythm, was developed using extensive looping and sampling. <i>A Moon Shaped Pool</i> (2016) prominently featured Jonny Greenwood's orchestral arrangements. Yorke, Jonny Greenwood, Selway, and O'Brien have released solo albums; in 2021, Yorke and Jonny Greenwood debuted a new band, the Smile.
</p><p>By 2011, Radiohead had sold more than 30 million albums worldwide. Their awards include six Grammy Awards and four Ivor Novello Awards, and they hold five Mercury Prize nominations, the most of any act. Seven Radiohead singles have reached the top 10 on the UK Singles Chart: ""Creep"" (1992), ""Street Spirit (Fade Out)"" (1996), ""Paranoid Android"" (1997), ""Karma Police"" (1997), ""No Surprises"" (1998), ""Pyramid Song"" (2001), and ""There There"" (2003). ""Creep"" and ""Nude"" (2008) reached the top 40 on the US <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. <i>Rolling Stone</i> named Radiohead one of the 100 greatest artists of all time, and <i>Rolling Stone</i> readers voted them the second-best artist of the 2000s. Five Radiohead albums have been included in <i>Rolling Stone</i><span>'</span>s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time lists. Radiohead were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2019.

</p>
<p><b>Red Hot Chili Peppers</b> are an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1982, comprising vocalist Anthony Kiedis, bassist Flea, drummer Chad Smith, and guitarist John Frusciante. Their music incorporates elements of alternative rock, funk, punk rock, hard rock, hip hop, and psychedelic rock. Their eclectic range has influenced genres such as funk metal, rap metal, rap rock, and nu metal. With over 120 million records sold worldwide, Red Hot Chili Peppers are one of the best-selling bands of all time. They hold the records for most number-one singles (15), most cumulative weeks at number one (91) and most top-ten songs (28) on the <i>Billboard</i> Alternative Songs chart. They have won six Grammy Awards, were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012, and in 2022 received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
</p><p>Red Hot Chili Peppers were formed in Los Angeles by Kiedis, Flea, guitarist Hillel Slovak and drummer Jack Irons. Due to commitments to other bands, Slovak and Irons did not play on the band's 1984 self-titled debut album, which instead featured guitarist Jack Sherman and drummer Cliff Martinez. Slovak rejoined for their second album, <i>Freaky Styley</i> (1985), and Irons for their third, <i>The Uplift Mofo Party Plan</i> (1987). Irons left after Slovak died of a drug overdose in June 1988.
</p><p>With new recruits Frusciante and Smith, Red Hot Chili Peppers recorded <i>Mother's Milk</i> (1989) and their first major commercial success, <i>Blood Sugar Sex Magik</i> (1991). Frusciante was uncomfortable with their newfound popularity and left abruptly on tour in 1992. After a series of temporary guitarists, he was replaced by Dave Navarro, who appeared on the group's sixth album, <i>One Hot Minute</i> (1995). Although successful, the album failed to match the critical or popular acclaim of <i>Blood Sugar Sex Magik</i>. Frusciante and Kiedis struggled with drug addiction throughout the 1990s.
</p><p>In 1998, following Navarro's departure, Frusciante rejoined the band. Their seventh album, <i>Californication</i> (1999), became their biggest commercial success, with 16 million copies sold worldwide. <i>By the Way</i> (2002) and <i>Stadium Arcadium</i> (2006) were also successful; <i>Stadium Arcadium</i> was their first album to reach number one on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 chart. Frusciante left again in 2009 to focus on his solo career; he was replaced by Josh Klinghoffer, who appeared on <i>I'm with You</i> (2011) and <i>The Getaway</i> (2016), before Frusciante rejoined in 2019. They released their 12th and 13th albums, <i>Unlimited Love</i> and <i>Return of the Dream Canteen</i>, in 2022.</p>",Los Angeles

</p>
<p><b>Marshall Bruce Mathers III</b> (born October 17, 1972), known professionally as <b>Eminem</b> (<span></span>; often stylized as <b>EMINƎM</b>), is an American rapper and record producer. He is credited with popularizing hip hop in middle America and is critically acclaimed as one of the greatest rappers of all time. Eminem's global success and acclaimed works are widely regarded as having broken racial barriers for the acceptance of white rappers in popular music. While much of his transgressive work during the late 1990s and early 2000s made him widely controversial, he came to be a representation of popular angst of the American underclass and has been cited as an influence for many artists of various genres.
</p><p>After the release of his debut album <i>Infinite</i> (1996) and the extended play <i>Slim Shady EP</i> (1997), Eminem signed with Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment and subsequently achieved mainstream popularity in 1999 with <i>The Slim Shady LP</i>. His next two releases, <i>The Marshall Mathers LP</i> (2000) and <i>The Eminem Show</i> (2002), were worldwide successes and were both nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. After the release of his next album, <i>Encore</i> (2004), Eminem went on hiatus in 2005, largely due to a prescription drug addiction. He returned to the music industry four years later with the release of <i>Relapse</i> (2009) and <i>Recovery</i> was released the following year. <i>Recovery</i> was the best-selling album worldwide of 2010, making it Eminem's second album, after <i>The Eminem Show</i> in 2002, to be the best-selling album of the year worldwide. In the following years, he released the US number one albums <i>The Marshall Mathers LP 2</i> (2013), <i>Revival</i> (2017), <i>Kamikaze</i> (2018) and <i>Music to Be Murdered By</i> (2020).
</p><p>Eminem made his debut in the film industry with the musical drama film <i>8 Mile</i> (2002), playing a fictionalized version of himself, and his track ""Lose Yourself"" from its soundtrack won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, making him the first hip hop artist ever to win the award. Eminem has made cameo appearances in the films <i>The Wash</i> (2001), <i>Funny People</i> (2009) and <i>The Interview</i> (2014) and the television series <i>Entourage</i> (2010). He has also developed other ventures, including Shady Records, a joint venture with manager Paul Rosenberg, which helped launch the careers of artists such as 50 Cent, D12 and Obie Trice, among others. He has also established his own channel, Shade 45, on Sirius XM Radio.
</p><p>In addition to his solo career, Eminem was a member of the hip hop group D12. He is also known for collaborations with fellow Detroit-based rapper Royce da 5'9""; the two are collectively known as Bad Meets Evil.
</p><p>Eminem is among the best-selling music artists of all time, with estimated worldwide sales of over 220 million records. He was the best-selling music artist in the United States of the 2000s and the best-selling male music artist in the United States of the 2010s, third overall. <i>Billboard</i> named him the ""Artist of the Decade (2000–2009)"". He has had ten number-one albums on the <i>Billboard</i> 200—which all consecutively debuted at number one on the chart, making him the first artist to achieve this—and five number-one singles on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. <i>The Marshall Mathers LP</i>, <i>The Eminem Show</i>, <i>Curtain Call: The Hits</i> (2005), ""Lose Yourself"", ""Love the Way You Lie"" and ""Not Afraid"" have all been certified Diamond or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). <i>Rolling Stone</i> has included him in its lists of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time and the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time. He has won numerous awards, including 15 Grammy Awards, eight American Music Awards, 17 <i>Billboard</i> Music Awards, an Academy Award, a Primetime Emmy Award and an MTV Europe Music Global Icon Award. In November 2022, Eminem was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.</p>

<p><b>The Killers</b> are an American rock band formed in Las Vegas in 2001 by Brandon Flowers (lead vocals, keyboards, bass) and Dave Keuning (lead guitar, backing vocals). After going through a number of short-term bass players and drummers in their early days, both Mark Stoermer (bass, rhythm guitar, backing vocals) and Ronnie Vannucci Jr. (drums, percussion) joined the band in 2002. The band's name is derived from a logo on the bass drum of a fictitious band portrayed in the music video for the New Order song ""Crystal"".</p><p>The Killers have released seven studio albums, each of which reached the top spot on the UK Albums Chart: <i>Hot Fuss</i> (2004), <i>Sam's Town</i> (2006), <i>Day &amp; Age</i> (2008), <i>Battle Born</i> (2012), <i>Wonderful Wonderful</i> (2017), <i>Imploding the Mirage</i> (2020), and <i>Pressure Machine</i> (2021). They have also released a B-sides and rarities compilation, <i>Sawdust</i> (2007); a live album, <i>Live from the Royal Albert Hall</i> (2009); a greatest-hits album, <i>Direct Hits</i> (2013); and a Christmas compilation, <i>Don't Waste Your Wishes</i> (2016).
</p><p>Since 2016 and 2017 respectively, both Stoermer and Keuning have had extended periods of hiatus from the band, though both remain official members. Stoermer mostly retired from touring, citing both exhaustion from the road and lingering effects from a pyrotechnics accident, while Keuning has released a solo album. Despite his hiatus from touring, Stoermer has participated in recording sessions for <i>Wonderful Wonderful</i> and <i>Imploding the Mirage</i>, and it was announced that Keuning was participating in recording <i>Pressure Machine</i>, which was released on August 13, 2021. Ted Sablay, who had served as a touring keyboardist and rhythm guitarist for the band since 2006, assumed lead guitar duties for live shows in Keuning's absence, while touring rhythm guitarist and keyboardist Jake Blanton took up the job of bassist and has taken Stoermer's place in live shows. With Sablay moving to lead guitar, the band hired Taylor Milne and Robbie Connolly to play rhythm guitar and keyboards live.
</p><p>The Killers are considered one of the biggest rock bands of the 21st century, selling more than 28 million records worldwide, including 10.8 million in the US alone. They have performed in over 50 countries and on six continents, headlining venues such as Madison Square Garden, Wembley Stadium and Glastonbury Festival (2007 and 2019).

He is also the founder and head of the creative content company Donda.
</p><p>West's outspoken views have received significant media coverage; he has been a frequent source of controversy due to his conduct on social media and at awards shows and public settings, as well as his comments on the music and fashion industries, U.S. politics, race, and slavery. His Christian faith, high-profile marriage to Kim Kardashian, and mental health have also been topics of media attention. In 2020, West launched an unsuccessful independent presidential campaign that primarily advocated for a consistent life ethic. In 2022, he was widely condemned and lost many sponsors and partnerships—including his collaborations with Adidas, Gap, and Balenciaga—after making a series of antisemitic statements. In November 2022, he announced his 2024 presidential campaign, appearing publicly with Nick Fuentes, a white supremacist. He later publicly praised Adolf Hitler, denied the Holocaust, and identified as a Nazi.</p>",

<p><b>Nirvana</b> was an American rock band formed in Aberdeen, Washington, in 1987. Founded by lead singer and guitarist Kurt Cobain and bassist Krist Novoselic, the band went through a succession of drummers, most notably Chad Channing, and then recruited Dave Grohl in 1990. Nirvana's success popularized alternative rock, and they were often referenced as the figurehead band of Generation X. Their music maintains a popular following and continues to influence modern rock culture.
</p><p>In the late 1980s, Nirvana established itself as part of the Seattle grunge scene, releasing its first album, <i>Bleach</i>, for the independent record label Sub Pop in 1989. They developed a sound that relied on dynamic contrasts, often between quiet verses and loud, heavy choruses. After signing to major label DGC Records in 1991, Nirvana found unexpected mainstream success with ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"", the first single from their landmark second album <i>Nevermind</i> (1991). A cultural phenomenon of the 1990s, <i>Nevermind</i> was certified Diamond by the RIAA and is credited for ending the dominance of hair metal.</p><p>Characterized by their punk aesthetic, Nirvana's fusion of pop melodies with noise, combined with their themes of abjection and social alienation, brought them global popularity. Following extensive tours and the 1992 compilation album <i>Incesticide</i> and EP <i>Hormoaning</i>, the band released their highly anticipated third studio album, <i>In Utero</i> (1993). The album topped both the US and UK album charts, and was acclaimed by critics. Nirvana disbanded following Cobain's suicide in April 1994. Various posthumous releases have been overseen by Novoselic, Grohl, and Cobain's widow Courtney Love. The posthumous live album <i>MTV Unplugged in New York</i> (1994) won Best Alternative Music Performance at the 1996 Grammy Awards.
</p><p>Nirvana is one of the best-selling bands of all time, having sold more than 75 million records worldwide. During their three years as a mainstream act, Nirvana received an American Music Award, Brit Award and Grammy Award, as well as seven MTV Video Music Awards and two NME Awards. They achieved five number-one hits on the <i>Billboard</i> Alternative Songs chart and four number-one albums on the <i>Billboard</i> 200. In 2004, <i>Rolling Stone</i> named Nirvana among the 100 greatest artists of all time. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in their first year of eligibility in 2014.

</p>
<p><b>Foo Fighters</b> is an American rock band formed in Seattle in 1994. Foo Fighters was initially formed as a one-man project by former Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl. Following the success of the 1995 eponymous debut album, Grohl (lead vocals, guitar) recruited a band consisting of Nate Mendel (bass guitar), William Goldsmith (drums), and Pat Smear (guitar). After a succession of lineup changes, including the departures of Goldsmith and Smear, the band formed its core lineup in 1999, consisting of Grohl, Mendel, Chris Shiflett (guitar), and Taylor Hawkins (drums). Smear rejoined in 2005, and Rami Jaffee (keys) joined in 2017.
</p><p>Prior to the release of the debut Foo Fighters album, Grohl recruited Mendel and Goldsmith, both formerly of Sunny Day Real Estate, and Smear, who had played with Nirvana on tour. The band began with performances in Portland, Oregon. Goldsmith quit during the recording of their second album, <i>The Colour and the Shape</i> (1997); most of the drum parts were re-recorded by Grohl. Smear departed soon afterward but appeared as a guest with the band frequently from 2005; he rejoined in 2010.
</p><p>Smear and Goldsmith were replaced by Franz Stahl and Taylor Hawkins; Stahl was fired before the recording of the group's third album, <i>There Is Nothing Left to Lose</i> (1999). The band briefly continued as a trio until Chris Shiflett joined on guitar after the completion of <i>There Is Nothing Left to Lose</i>. Foo Fighters released their fourth album, <i>One by One</i>, in 2002. It was followed with the two-disc <i>In Your Honor</i> (2005), which was split between acoustic songs and heavier material. Foo Fighters released their sixth album, <i>Echoes, Silence, Patience &amp; Grace</i>, in 2007.
</p><p>For Foo Fighters' seventh studio album, <i>Wasting Light</i> (2011), produced by Butch Vig, Smear returned as a full member. <i>Sonic Highways</i> (2014) was released as the soundtrack to the television miniseries directed by Grohl. <i>Concrete and Gold</i> (2017) was the second Foo Fighters album to reach number one in the United States and their first studio album to feature longtime session and touring keyboardist Rami Jaffee as a full member. The band's tenth album, <i>Medicine at Midnight</i> (2021), was the last to feature Hawkins, who died in March 2022.
</p><p>Over the course of their career, Foo Fighters have won 15 Grammy Awards, including Best Rock Album five times, making them among the most successful rock acts in Grammy history. In 2021, the band was announced as recipients of the first-ever ""Global Icon"" award at the 2021 MTV Video Music Awards. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2021, their first year of eligibility.

</p>
<p><b>The Rolling Stones</b> are an English rock band formed in London in 1962. Active for six decades, they are one of the most popular and enduring bands of the rock era. In the early 1960s, the Rolling Stones pioneered the gritty, rhythmically driven sound that came to define hard rock. Their first stable line-up consisted of vocalist Mick Jagger, multi-instrumentalist Brian Jones, guitarist Keith Richards, bassist Bill Wyman, and drummer Charlie Watts. During their formative years, Jones was the primary leader: he assembled the band, named it, and drove their sound and image. After Andrew Loog Oldham became the group's manager in 1963, he encouraged them to write their own songs. Jagger and Richards became the primary creative force behind the band, alienating Jones, who had developed a drug addiction that interfered with his ability to contribute meaningfully.
</p><p>Rooted in blues and early rock and roll, the Rolling Stones started out playing covers and were at the forefront of the British Invasion in 1964, becoming identified with the youthful and rebellious counterculture of the 1960s. They then found greater success with their own material, as ""(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction"" (1965), ""Get Off of My Cloud"" (1965), and ""Paint It Black"" (1966) became international number-one hits. <i>Aftermath</i> (1966) – their first entirely original album – is considered by <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> to be the most important of their formative records. In 1967, they had the double-sided hit ""Ruby Tuesday""/""Let's Spend the Night Together"" and experimented with psychedelic rock on <i>Their Satanic Majesties Request</i>. They returned to their rhythm and blues roots with hit songs such as ""Jumpin' Jack Flash"" (1968) and ""Honky Tonk Women"" (1969), and albums such as <i>Beggars Banquet</i> (1968), featuring ""Sympathy for the Devil"", and <i>Let It Bleed</i> (1969), featuring ""You Can't Always Get What You Want"" and ""Gimme Shelter"". <i>Let It Bleed</i> was the first of five consecutive number-one albums in the UK.
</p><p>Jones left the band shortly before his death in 1969, having been replaced by guitarist Mick Taylor. That year they were first introduced on stage as ""The Greatest Rock and Roll Band in the World"". <i>Sticky Fingers</i> (1971), which yielded ""Brown Sugar"" and included the first usage of their tongue and lips logo, was their first of eight consecutive number-one studio albums in the US. <i>Exile on Main St.</i> (1972), featuring ""Tumbling Dice"", and <i>Goats Head Soup</i> (1973), yielding the hit ballad ""Angie"", were also best sellers. Taylor was replaced by Ronnie Wood in 1974. The band continued to release successful albums, including their two largest sellers: <i>Some Girls</i> (1978), featuring ""Miss You"", and <i>Tattoo You</i> (1981), featuring ""Start Me Up"". <i>Steel Wheels</i> (1989) was widely considered a comeback album and was followed by <i>Voodoo Lounge</i> (1994), a worldwide number-one album. Both releases were promoted by large stadium and arena tours, as the Stones continued to be a huge concert attraction; by 2007 they had recorded the all-time highest-grossing concert tour three times, and as recently as 2021 they were the highest-earning live act of the year. From Wyman's departure in 1993 to Watts' death in 2021, the band continued as a four-piece core, with Darryl Jones playing bass on tour and on most studio recordings, while Steve Jordan became their touring drummer following Watts' death. Their 2016 album, <i>Blue &amp; Lonesome</i>, became their twelfth UK number-one album.
</p><p>The Rolling Stones' estimated record sales of 200 million make them one of the best-selling music artists of all time. The band has won three Grammy Awards and a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2004. <i>Billboard</i> magazine and <i>Rolling Stone</i> have ranked the band as one of the greatest of all time.

</p>
<p><b>Daft Punk</b> were a French electronic music duo formed in 1993 in Paris by Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo. They achieved popularity in the late 1990s as part of the French house movement, combining elements of house music with funk, disco, rock and pop. They garnered acclaim and commercial success and are regarded as one of the most influential acts in dance music.
</p><p>Bangalter and Homem-Christo formed Daft Punk after their indie rock band Darlin' disbanded and began experimenting with drum machines and synthesisers. Their debut studio album, <i>Homework</i>, was released by Virgin Records in 1997 to positive reviews, backed by the singles ""Around the World"" and ""Da Funk"". From 1999, Daft Punk assumed robot personas for public appearances, with helmets, outfits and gloves to disguise their identities; they made few media appearances. They were managed from 1996 to 2008 by Pedro Winter, the head of Ed Banger Records.
</p><p>Daft Punk's second album, <i>Discovery</i> (2001), had further success, with the hit singles ""One More Time"", ""Digital Love"" and ""Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger"". It became the basis for an animated film, <i>Interstella 5555,</i> supervised by the Japanese artist Leiji Matsumoto. Daft Punk's third album, <i>Human After All</i> (2005), received mixed reviews, though the singles ""Robot Rock"" and ""Technologic"" achieved success in the United Kingdom. Daft Punk directed an avant-garde science-fiction film, <i>Electroma</i>, released in 2006. They toured throughout 2006 and 2007 and released the live album <i>Alive 2007</i>, which won a Grammy Award for Best Electronic/Dance Album; the tour is credited for popularising dance music in North America. Daft Punk composed the score for the 2010 film <i>Tron: Legacy</i>.
</p><p>In 2013, Daft Punk left Virgin for Columbia Records and released their fourth and final album, <i>Random Access Memories</i>, to acclaim; the lead single, ""Get Lucky"", reached the top 10 in the charts of 27 countries. <i>Random Access Memories</i> won five Grammy Awards in 2014, including Album of the Year and Record of the Year for ""Get Lucky"". In 2016, Daft Punk gained their only number one on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 with ""Starboy"", a collaboration with the Weeknd. In 2015, <i>Rolling Stone</i> ranked them the 12th greatest musical duo of all time. They announced their split in 2021.

<p><b>Green Day</b> is an American rock band formed in the East Bay of California in 1987 by lead vocalist and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong, together with bassist and backing vocalist Mike Dirnt. For most of the band's career, they have been a power trio with drummer Tré Cool, who replaced John Kiffmeyer in 1990 before the recording of the band's second studio album, <i>Kerplunk</i> (1991). Touring guitarist Jason White became a full-time member in 2012, but returned to his touring role in 2016. Before taking its current name in 1989, Green Day was called <b>Sweet Children</b>, and they were part of the late 1980s/early 1990s Bay Area punk scene that emerged from the 924 Gilman Street club in Berkeley, California. The band's early releases were with the independent record label Lookout! Records. In 1994, their major-label debut <i>Dookie</i>, released through Reprise Records, became a breakout success and eventually shipped over 10 million copies in the U.S. Alongside fellow California punk bands Bad Religion, the Offspring, Rancid, NOFX, Pennywise and Social Distortion, Green Day is credited with popularizing mainstream interest in punk rock in the U.S.
</p><p>Though the albums <i>Insomniac</i> (1995), <i>Nimrod</i> (1997), and <i>Warning</i> (2000) did not match the success of <i>Dookie</i>, they were still successful, with the former two reaching double platinum status, while the latter achieved gold. Green Day's seventh album, a rock opera called <i>American Idiot</i> (2004), found popularity with a younger generation, selling six million copies in the U.S. Their next album, <i>21st Century Breakdown</i>, was released in 2009 and achieved the band's best chart performance. It was followed by a trilogy of albums, <i>¡Uno!</i>, <i>¡Dos!</i>, and <i>¡Tré!</i>, released in September, November, and December 2012, respectively. The trilogy did not perform as well as expected commercially, in comparison to their previous albums, largely due to lack of promotion and Armstrong entering rehab. Their twelfth studio album, <i>Revolution Radio</i>, was released in October 2016 and became their third to debut at No. 1 on the <i> Billboard</i> 200. The band's thirteenth studio album, <i>Father of All Motherfuckers</i>, was released on February 7, 2020.
</p><p>In 2010, a stage adaptation of <i>American Idiot</i> debuted on Broadway. The musical was nominated for three Tony Awards: Best Musical, Best Scenic Design, and Best Lighting Design, winning the latter two. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2015, their first year of eligibility. Members of the band have collaborated on the side projects Pinhead Gunpowder, the Network, Foxboro Hot Tubs, the Longshot, and the Coverups. They have also worked on solo careers.
</p><p>Green Day has sold more than 75 million records worldwide, making them one of the world's best-selling artists. The group has been nominated for 20 Grammy awards and has won five of them with Best Alternative Album for <i>Dookie</i>, Best Rock Album for <i>American Idiot</i> and <i>21st Century Breakdown</i>, Record of the Year for ""Boulevard of Broken Dreams"", and Best Musical Show Album for <i>American Idiot: The Original Broadway Cast Recording</i>.

<p><b>Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson</b> (born October 25, 1984), known professionally as <b>Katy Perry</b>, is an American singer, songwriter, and television personality. Known for her influence on modern pop music and her campy style, she has been referred to as the ""Queen of Camp"" by <i>Vogue</i>. Pursuing a career in gospel music at 16, Perry released her debut album, <i>Katy Hudson</i>, under Red Hill Records in 2001, which was commercially unsuccessful. She moved to Los Angeles at 17 to venture into secular music, and later adopted the stage name ""Katy Perry"" from her mother's maiden name. She recorded an album while signed to Columbia Records, but was dropped before signing to Capitol Records.
</p><p>She rose to fame with <i>One of the Boys</i> (2008), a pop rock record containing her debut single ""I Kissed a Girl"" and follow-up single ""Hot n Cold"", which reached number one and three on the U.S. <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 respectively. The disco-influenced pop album <i>Teenage Dream</i> (2010) spawned five U.S. number one singles—""California Gurls"", ""Teenage Dream"", ""Firework"", ""E.T."", and ""Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)""—becoming the only album by a female singer to do so. A reissue of the album titled <i>Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection</i> (2012) subsequently produced the U.S. number one single ""Part of Me"". Her empowerment-themed album <i>Prism</i> (2013) had two U.S. number one singles ""Roar"" and ""Dark Horse"". Both their respective music videos made Perry the first artist to have multiple videos reach one billion views on Vevo. The electropop album <i>Witness</i> (2017) featured themes of feminism and a political subtext, while <i>Smile</i> (2020) was influenced by her recent motherhood and mental health journey. Afterwards, she embarked on her Las Vegas concert residency titled Play (2021–present), receiving critical acclaim and commercial success.
</p><p>Perry is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold over 143 million records worldwide. All of her studio albums released under Capitol have individually surpassed one billion streams on Spotify, totaling six billion streams. She has nine U.S. number one singles, three U.S. number one albums and has received various accolades, including a Billboard Spotlight Award (currently the only female artist to have one), four Guinness World Records, five <i>Billboard</i> Music Awards, five American Music Awards, a Brit Award, and a Juno Award. Perry has been included in the annual <i>Forbes</i> lists of highest-earning women in music from 2011 to 2019. Her acclaimed Super Bowl halftime show performance in 2015 is the most watched in history. Outside of music, she released an autobiographical documentary titled <i>Katy Perry: Part of Me</i> in 2012, voiced Smurfette in <i>The Smurfs</i> film series, and launched her own shoe line Katy Perry Collections in 2017. Perry began serving as a judge on <i>American Idol</i> during its sixteenth season in 2018. She is also the most-followed woman and the third most-followed person on Twitter, with over 100 million followers.

</p>
<p><b>Oasis</b> were an English rock band formed in Manchester in 1991. Originally known as the Rain, the group initially consisted of Liam Gallagher (lead vocals, tambourine), Paul Arthurs (guitar), Paul McGuigan (bass guitar) and Tony McCarroll (drums). Liam's older brother Noel (lead guitar, vocals) later joined as a fifth member, finalising the group's core lineup. During the course of their existence, they had various lineup changes, with the Gallagher brothers remaining the only staple members. 
</p><p>Oasis signed to independent record label Creation Records in 1993 and released their record-setting debut album <i>Definitely Maybe</i> (1994). The following year they recorded <i>(What's the Story) Morning Glory?</i> (1995) with drummer Alan White, in the midst of a chart rivalry with peers Blur. Spending ten weeks at number one on the UK Albums Chart, <i>(What's the Story) Morning Glory?</i> was also an international chart success and became one of the best-selling albums of all time. In addition, it stands as the fifth-best-selling album in the UK and the biggest-selling album in the UK of the 1990s. The Gallagher brothers featured regularly in tabloid newspapers for their disputes and wild lifestyles. In 1996, Oasis performed two nights at Knebworth for an audience of 125,000 each time, the largest outdoor concerts in UK history at the time. In 1997, Oasis released their third album, <i>Be Here Now</i>. It became the fastest-selling album in UK chart history.
</p><p>Oasis' popularity later declined and McGuigan and Arthurs left in 1999 as Oasis released <i>Standing on the Shoulder of Giants</i> (2000). They were replaced by former Heavy Stereo guitarist Gem Archer and former Ride guitarist Andy Bell. White departed in 2004, replaced by Zak Starkey and later Chris Sharrock as touring members. Oasis released three more studio albums, <i>Heathen Chemistry</i> (2002), <i>Don't Believe the Truth</i> (2005) and <i>Dig Out Your Soul</i> (2008). The group abruptly disbanded after the departure of Noel Gallagher in August 2009.
</p><p>As of 2009, Oasis had sold over 70 million records worldwide. They are among the most successful acts on the UK Singles Chart and Albums Chart, with eight UK number-one singles and eight UK number-one albums. The band also achieved three platinum albums in the US. They won 17 <i>NME</i> Awards, nine Q Awards, four MTV Europe Music Awards and six Brit Awards, including one in 2007 for Outstanding Contribution to Music and one for the ""Best Album of the Last 30 Years"" for <i>(What's the Story) Morning Glory?</i>. They were nominated for two Grammy Awards.</p>

<p><b>Gorillaz</b> are an English virtual band formed in 1998 by musician Damon Albarn and artist Jamie Hewlett, from London. The band primarily consists of four fictional members: 2-D (vocals, keyboards), Murdoc Niccals (bass guitar), Noodle (guitar, keyboards, vocals), and Russel Hobbs (drums). Their universe is presented in music videos, interviews, comic strips and short cartoons. Gorillaz' music has featured collaborations with a wide range of featured artists, with Albarn as the only permanent musical contributor.
</p><p>With Gorillaz, Albarn departed from the distinct Britpop of his band Blur, exploring a variety of musical styles including hip hop, electronic music and world music through an ""eccentrically postmodern"" approach. The band's 2001 debut album <i>Gorillaz</i>, which featured dub, Latin and punk influences, went triple platinum in the UK and double platinum in Europe, with sales driven by the success of the album's lead single ""Clint Eastwood"". Their second studio album, <i>Demon Days</i> (2005), went six times platinum in the UK and double platinum in the US and spawned the successful lead single ""Feel Good Inc.""</p><p>The band's third album, <i>Plastic Beach</i> (2010), featured environmentalist themes, a synth-pop approach and an expanded roster of featured artists.

During 2015, Remi Kabaka Jr. became a music producer for the band after more than 10 years providing the voice of Russel and was credited as such alongside Albarn and Hewlett in the official 2019 documentary <i>Gorillaz: Reject False Icons</i>. The band's fifth album, <i>Humanz</i>, was released after a seven-year hiatus on 28 April 2017. Their sixth album, <i>The Now Now</i> (2018), featured stripped-down production and a greater musical focus on Albarn. Gorillaz' started a new project in 2020, <i>Song Machine</i>, a music-based web series with episodes that consist of standalone singles and accompanying music videos featuring different guests each episode, resulting in their seventh album, <i>Song Machine, Season One: Strange Timez</i> (2020). In 2023, the band will release its eighth studio album, <i>Cracker Island</i>.
</p><p>Gorillaz has presented itself live in a variety of different ways throughout the band's history, such as hiding the touring band from the audience's view in the early years of the project, projecting animated band members on stage via computer graphics and traditional live touring featuring a fully visible live band. The band have sold over 27 million records worldwide and are cited by <i>Guinness World Records</i> as the world's ""Most Successful Virtual Band"". They have won a Grammy Award, two MTV Video Music Awards, an NME Award and four MTV Europe Music Awards.

<p><b>Michael Joseph Jackson</b> (August 29, 1958 – June 25, 2009) was an American singer, songwriter, dancer, and philanthropist. Dubbed the ""King of Pop"", he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century. Over a four-decade career, his contributions to music, dance, and fashion, along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture. Jackson influenced artists across many music genres; through stage and video performances, he popularized complicated dance moves such as the moonwalk, to which he gave the name, as well as the robot. He is the most awarded recording artist in pop music history.</p><p>The eighth child of the Jackson family, Jackson made his public debut in 1964 with his older brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon as a member of the Jackson 5 (later known as the Jacksons). Jackson began his solo career in 1971 while at Motown Records. He became a solo star with his 1979 album <i>Off the Wall</i>. His music videos, including those for ""Beat It"", ""Billie Jean"", and ""Thriller"" from his 1982 album <i>Thriller</i>, are credited with breaking racial barriers and transforming the medium into an artform and promotional tool. He helped propel the success of MTV and continued to innovate with videos for the albums <i>Bad</i> (1987), <i>Dangerous</i> (1991), <i>HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I</i> (1995), and <i>Invincible</i> (2001). <i>Thriller</i> became the best-selling album of all time, while <i>Bad</i> was the first album to produce five US <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 number-one singles.</p><p>From the late 1980s, Jackson became a figure of controversy and speculation due to his changing appearance, relationships, behavior, and lifestyle. In 1993, he was accused of sexually abusing the child of a family friend. The lawsuit was settled out of civil court; Jackson was not indicted due to lack of evidence. In 2005, he was tried and acquitted of further child sexual abuse allegations and several other charges. The FBI found no evidence of criminal conduct by Jackson in either case. In 2009, while he was preparing for a series of comeback concerts, This Is It, Jackson died from an overdose of propofol administered by his personal physician, Conrad Murray, who was convicted in 2011 of involuntary manslaughter. His death triggered reactions around the world, creating unprecedented surges of Internet traffic and a spike in sales of his music. A televised memorial service for Jackson, held at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, was viewed by an estimated over 2.5 billion people globally.
</p><p>Jackson is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with estimated sales of over 400<span> </span>million records worldwide. He had 13 <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 number-one singles (third highest of any artist in the Hot 100 era) and was the first artist to have a top-ten single in the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 in five different decades. He is regarded by the RIAA as the highest-selling individual music artist of all time worldwide. His honors include 15 Grammy Awards, 6 Brit Awards, a Golden Globe Award, and 39 Guinness World Records, including the ""Most Successful Entertainer of All Time"". Jackson's inductions include the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (twice), the Vocal Group Hall of Fame, the Songwriters Hall of Fame, the Dance Hall of Fame (the only recording artist to be inducted), and the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame.

<p><b>Maroon 5</b> is an American pop rock band from Los Angeles, California. It currently consists of lead vocalist Adam Levine, keyboardist and rhythm guitarist Jesse Carmichael, lead guitarist James Valentine, drummer Matt Flynn, keyboardist PJ Morton and multi-instrumentalist and bassist Sam Farrar. Original members Levine, Carmichael, bassist Mickey Madden, and drummer Ryan Dusick first came together as <b>Kara's Flowers</b> in 1994, while they were still in high school.
</p><p>After self-releasing their independent album <i>We Like Digging?</i>, the band signed to Reprise Records and released the album <i>The Fourth World</i> in 1997. The album garnered a tepid response, after which the record label dropped the band and the members focused on college. In 2001, the band re-emerged as Maroon 5, pursuing a different direction and adding guitarist Valentine. The band signed with Octone Records, an independent record label with a separate joint venture relationship with J Records and released their debut album <i>Songs About Jane</i> in June 2002. Aided by the hit singles ""Harder to Breathe"", ""This Love"" and ""She Will Be Loved"", the album peaked at number six on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 chart and went quadruple platinum in 2005. In the same year, the band won the Grammy Award for Best New Artist. In 2006, Dusick left the band after suffering from serious wrist and shoulder injuries and was replaced by Matt Flynn.
</p><p>The band's second album <i>It Won't Be Soon Before Long</i> was released in May 2007. It debuted at number one on the US <i>Billboard</i> 200 chart and the lead single ""Makes Me Wonder"", became the band's first number-one single on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. In 2010, the band released the third album <i>Hands All Over</i>, to favorable reviews, re-releasing a year later to include the single ""Moves like Jagger"", which topped the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. In 2012, Carmichael left the group and was replaced by musician PJ Morton, as the band released the fourth album <i>Overexposed</i>, with the song ""One More Night"", topping the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 chart for nine consecutive weeks.
</p><p>In 2014, Carmichael rejoined the band alongside Morton to record the fifth album <i>V</i> (roman numeral pronounced ""five""), with the band signed to Interscope Records and Levine's own label 222 Records. Following the release of <i>V</i>, it reached number one on the <i>Billboard</i> 200. In 2016, Maroon 5 recruited their long-time collaborator Sam Farrar, as the band continued for the sixth studio album <i>Red Pill Blues</i>, which was released in November 2017. With the addition of Morton and Farrar, the band's lineup increased to seven members. The successful singles of both albums ""Sugar"" and ""Girls Like You"" peaked at numbers two and one on the Hot 100 chart respectively.

<p><b>Arctic Monkeys</b> are an English rock band formed in Sheffield in 2002. The group consists of Alex Turner (lead vocals, guitar, keyboards), Jamie Cook (guitar, keyboards), Nick O'Malley (bass guitar, backing vocals), and Matt Helders (drums, backing vocals). Former band member Andy Nicholson (bass guitar, backing vocals) left the band in 2006 shortly after their debut album was released.
</p><p>Arctic Monkeys were heralded as one of the first bands to come to public attention via the Internet, with commentators suggesting they represented the possibility of a change in the way in which new bands are promoted and marketed. Their debut album, <i>Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not</i> (2006), became the fastest-selling debut album in UK chart history, and has been hailed as one of the greatest debut albums. It won Best British Album at the 2007 Brit Awards. The band's second album, <i>Favourite Worst Nightmare</i> (2007), was also acclaimed by critics and won Best British Album at the 2008 BRIT Awards. They went on to release <i>Humbug</i> (2009) and <i>Suck It and See</i> (2011).
</p><p>The band's wider international fame came with the success of their critically acclaimed fifth album <i>AM</i> (2013), which was supported by the global hit ""Do I Wanna Know?"". It topped four <i>Billboard</i> charts and was certified platinum in the US. At the 2014 BRIT Awards, the album became their third to win British Album of the Year. Their sixth album, <i>Tranquility Base Hotel &amp; Casino</i> (2018), was a major departure from the band's previous guitar-heavy work, instead being piano-oriented. It received a Best Alternative Music Album nomination at the 2019 Grammy Awards, their second to do so after <i>Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not</i>.
</p><p>In the United Kingdom, the band became the first independent-label band to debut at number one in the UK with their first five albums. The band have won seven Brit Awards; winning Best British Group and British Album of the Year three times, becoming the first band to ever ""do the double"" (that is, win in both categories) three times; a Mercury Prize for <i>Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not</i>, an Ivor Novello Award, and 20 NME Awards. In addition, they have been nominated for six Grammy Awards, and received Mercury Prize nominations in 2007, 2013, and 2018. Both <i>Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not</i> and <i>AM</i> are included in <i>NME</i><span>'</span>s and different editions of <i>Rolling Stone</i><span>'</span>s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time lists.

</p>
<p><b>U2</b> are an Irish rock band from Dublin, formed in 1976. The group consists of Bono (lead vocals and rhythm guitar), the Edge (lead guitar, keyboards, and backing vocals), Adam Clayton (bass guitar), and Larry Mullen Jr. (drums and percussion). Initially rooted in post-punk, U2's musical style has evolved throughout their career, yet has maintained an anthemic quality built on Bono's expressive vocals and the Edge's chiming, effects-based guitar sounds. Bono's lyrics, often embellished with spiritual imagery, focus on personal and sociopolitical themes. Popular for their live performances, the group have staged several ambitious and elaborate tours over their career.
</p><p>The band was formed when the members were teenaged pupils of Mount Temple Comprehensive School and had limited musical proficiency. Within four years, they signed with Island Records and released their debut album, <i>Boy</i> (1980). Works such as their first UK number-one album, <i>War</i> (1983), and the singles ""Sunday Bloody Sunday"" and ""Pride (In the Name of Love)"" helped establish U2's reputation as a politically and socially conscious group. By the mid-1980s, they had become renowned globally for their live act, highlighted by their performance at Live Aid in 1985. U2's fifth album, <i>The Joshua Tree</i> (1987), made them international stars and was their greatest critical and commercial success. Topping music charts around the world, it produced their only number-one singles in the US to date: ""With or Without You"" and ""I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For"".
</p><p>Facing creative stagnation and a backlash to their documentary/double album, <i>Rattle and Hum</i> (1988), U2 reinvented themselves in the 1990s. Beginning with their acclaimed seventh album, <i>Achtung Baby</i> (1991), and the multimedia-intensive Zoo TV Tour, the band pursued a new musical direction influenced by alternative rock, electronic dance music, and industrial music, and they embraced a more ironic, flippant image. This experimentation continued through their ninth album, <i>Pop</i> (1997), and the PopMart Tour, which were mixed successes. U2 regained critical and commercial favour with the records <i>All That You Can't Leave Behind</i> (2000) and <i>How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb</i> (2004), which established a more conventional, mainstream sound for the group. Their U2 360° Tour of 2009–2011 set records for the highest-attended and highest-grossing concert tour, both of which were surpassed in 2019. The group most recently released the companion albums <i>Songs of Innocence</i> (2014) and <i>Songs of Experience</i> (2017), the former of which received criticism for its pervasive, no-cost release through the iTunes Store.
</p><p>U2 have released 14 studio albums and are one of the world's best-selling music artists, having sold an estimated 150–170 million records worldwide. They have won 22 Grammy Awards, more than any other band, and in 2005, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in their first year of eligibility. <i>Rolling Stone</i> ranked U2 at number 22 on its list of the ""100 Greatest Artists of All Time"". Throughout their career, as a band and as individuals, they have campaigned for human rights and social justice causes, including Amnesty International, Jubilee 2000, the ONE/DATA campaigns, Product Red, War Child, and Music Rising.

</p>
<p><b>David Robert Jones</b> (8 January 1947 – 10 January 2016), known professionally as <b>David Bowie</b> (<span></span> <i title=""English pronunciation respelling""><span>BOH</span>-ee</i>), was an English singer-songwriter and actor. A leading figure in the music industry, he is regarded as one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century. Bowie was acclaimed by critics and musicians, particularly for his innovative work during the 1970s. His career was marked by reinvention and visual presentation, and his music and stagecraft had a significant impact on popular music.
</p><p>Bowie developed an interest in music from an early age. He studied art, music and design before embarking on a professional career as a musician in 1963. ""Space Oddity"", released in 1969, was his first top-five entry on the UK Singles Chart. After a period of experimentation, he re-emerged in 1972 during the glam rock era with his flamboyant and androgynous alter ego Ziggy Stardust. The character was spearheaded by the success of Bowie's single ""Starman"" and album <i>The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars</i>, which won him widespread popularity. In 1975, Bowie's style shifted towards a sound he characterised as ""plastic soul"", initially alienating many of his UK fans but garnering him his first major US crossover success with the number-one single ""Fame"" and the album <i>Young Americans</i>. In 1976, Bowie starred in the cult film <i>The Man Who Fell to Earth</i> and released <i>Station to Station</i>. In 1977, he again changed direction with the electronic-inflected album <i>Low</i>, the first of three collaborations with Brian Eno that came to be known as the ""Berlin Trilogy"". <i>""Heroes""</i> (1977) and <i>Lodger</i> (1979) followed; each album reached the UK top five and received lasting critical praise.
</p><p>After uneven commercial success in the late 1970s, Bowie had three number-one hits: the 1980 single ""Ashes to Ashes"", its album <i>Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)</i>, and ""Under Pressure"" (a 1981 collaboration with Queen). He achieved massive commercial success in the 1980s with <i>Let's Dance</i> (1983). Between 1988 and 1992, he fronted the hard rock band Tin Machine before resuming his solo career in 1993. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Bowie continued to experiment with musical styles, including industrial and jungle. He also continued acting; his roles included Major Jack Celliers in <i>Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence</i> (1983), Jareth the Goblin King in <i>Labyrinth</i> (1986), Pontius Pilate in <i>The Last Temptation of Christ</i> (1988), and Nikola Tesla in <i>The Prestige</i> (2006), among other film and television appearances and cameos. He stopped touring after 2004 and his last live performance was at a charity event in 2006. In 2013, Bowie returned from a decade-long recording hiatus with <i>The Next Day</i>. He remained musically active until his death from liver cancer at his home in New York City. He died two days after both his 69th birthday and the release of his final album, <i>Blackstar</i> (2016).
</p><p>During his lifetime, his record sales, estimated at over 100 million records worldwide, made him one of the best-selling musicians of all time. In the UK, he was awarded ten platinum, eleven gold and eight silver album certifications, and released 11 number-one albums. In the US, he received five platinum and nine gold certifications. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996. <i>Rolling Stone</i> ranked him among the greatest artists in history. As of 2022, Bowie was the best-selling vinyl artist of the 21st century.

</p>
<p><b>Black Eyed Peas</b> (also known as <b>The Black Eyed Peas</b>) are an American musical group consisting of rappers will.i.am, apl.de.ap and Taboo. The group's line-up during the height of their popularity in the 2000s featured Fergie, who replaced Kim Hill in 2002. Originally an alternative hip hop group, they subsequently refashioned themselves as a more marketable pop-rap act. Although the group was founded in Los Angeles in 1995, it was not until the release of their third album <i>Elephunk</i> in 2003 that they achieved high record sales.
</p><p>The Black Eyed Peas' first major hit was the 2003 single ""Where Is the Love?"" from <i>Elephunk</i>, which topped the charts in 13 countries, including the United Kingdom, where it spent seven weeks at number one and went on to become Britain's biggest-selling single of 2003. Their fourth album, <i>Monkey Business</i>, was an even bigger worldwide success, and became certified 3× Platinum in the United States. In 2009, the group became one of only 11 artists to have simultaneously held the number-one and number-two spots on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100, with their singles ""Boom Boom Pow"" and ""I Gotta Feeling"", which topped the chart for an unprecedented 26 consecutive weeks.
</p><p>The album <i>The E.N.D.</i> produced a third Hot 100 number-one placement with ""Imma Be"", making the group one of few to ever place three number one singles on the chart from the same album, before being followed with ""Rock That Body"" and ""Meet Me Halfway"", which peaked in the top 10 of the Hot 100. ""I Gotta Feeling"" became the first single to sell more than one million downloads in the United Kingdom. At the 52nd Grammy Awards ceremony, held in January 2010, they won three awards out of six nominations. In November 2010, they released the album <i>The Beginning</i>. In February 2011, they performed in the Super Bowl XLV halftime show. Shortly after, the group announced they would be going on indefinite hiatus to pursue other activities, eventually reuniting in 2015.
</p><p>In 2018, Fergie was announced to have left the group after making sporadic appearances with them since their return in 2015. That year, she was subsequently replaced by J. Rey Soul for touring, who also appeared as a featured artist on select tracks on the group's seventh album, <i>Masters of the Sun Vol. 1</i>. They released their eighth album, <i>Translation</i>, in July 2020 and their ninth, <i>Elevation</i> in November 2022.
</p><p>The Black Eyed Peas have sold an estimated 80 million records, making them one of the best-selling groups of all time. They were ranked 12th on <i>Billboard</i><span>'</span>s 2000s Decade-End Artist of the Decade Chart, and 7th on the Hot 100 Artists of the Decade.

<p><b>The Strokes</b> is an American rock band from New York City. Formed in 1998, the band is composed of lead singer and songwriter Julian Casablancas, guitarists Nick Valensi and Albert Hammond Jr., bassist Nikolai Fraiture, and drummer Fabrizio Moretti. They were a leading group of the early-2000s indie rock revival.
</p><p>The release of their EP <i>The Modern Age</i> in early 2001 sparked a bidding war among major labels, with the band eventually signing to RCA Records. That summer, they released their debut album, <i>Is This It</i>, to critical acclaim and strong sales. It has since appeared on numerous ""best album"" lists. It was followed by <i>Room on Fire</i> (2003) and <i>First Impressions of Earth</i> (2005), both of which sold well but failed to match <i>Is This It</i> in critical success.
</p><p>Following a five-year hiatus, they released <i>Angles</i> (2011) to a generally positive reception, and <i>Comedown Machine</i> (2013) to lukewarm critical reception, both with dwindling sales. Following the end of their initial contract with RCA, they released the <i>Future Present Past</i> EP (2016) through Casablancas' label Cult. The band were relatively inactive throughout the decade, making infrequent live appearances and directing most media attention to individual projects.
</p><p>In 2020, they released their first studio album in seven years, <i>The New Abnormal</i>, produced by Rick Rubin and released through Cult and RCA. Critics considered the album a return to form. It went on to win Best Rock Album at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards.</p>",

</p>
<p><b>Britney Jean Spears</b> (born December 2, 1981) is an American singer. Often referred to as the ""Princess of Pop"", she is credited with influencing the revival of teen pop during the late 1990s and early 2000s. After appearing in stage productions and television series, Spears signed with Jive Records in 1997 at age fifteen. Her first two studio albums, <i>...Baby One More Time</i> (1999) and <i>Oops!... I Did It Again</i> (2000), are among the best-selling albums of all time and made Spears the best-selling teenage artist of all time. With first-week sales of over 1.3 million copies, <i>Oops!... I Did It Again</i> held the record for the fastest-selling album by a female artist in the United States for fifteen years. Spears adopted a more mature and provocative style for her albums <i>Britney</i> (2001) and <i>In the Zone</i> (2003), and starred in the 2002 film <i>Crossroads</i>.
</p><p>Spears was executive producer of her fifth studio album <i>Blackout</i> (2007), often referred to as her best work. Following a series of highly publicized personal problems, promotion for the album was limited, and Spears was involuntarily placed in a conservatorship. Since then, she released the chart-topping albums, <i>Circus</i> (2008) and <i>Femme Fatale</i> (2011), the latter of which became her most successful era of singles in the US charts. She embarked on a four-year concert residency, Britney: Piece of Me, at Planet Hollywood Resort &amp; Casino in Las Vegas to promote her next two albums <i>Britney Jean</i> (2013) and <i>Glory</i> (2016). In 2019, Spears's legal battle over her conservatorship became more publicized and led to the establishment of the #FreeBritney movement. In 2021, the conservatorship was terminated following her public testimony in which she accused her management team and family of abuse.</p><p>Regarded as a pop icon, Spears has sold over 100 million records worldwide, including over 70 million in the United States, making her one of the world's best-selling music artists. She has achieved six number-one albums on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 and four number-one singles on the US <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100: ""...Baby One More Time"", ""Womanizer"", ""3"", and ""Hold It Against Me"". The ""S&amp;M"" remix also topped the <i>Billboard</i> chart. Her singles ""Oops!... I Did It Again"", ""Toxic"", and ""Scream &amp; Shout"" topped the charts in most countries. With ""3"" in 2009 and ""Hold It Against Me"" in 2011, Spears became the second artist after Mariah Carey in the Hot 100's history to debut at number one with two or more songs. Her heavily choreographed videos earned her the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award. She has earned numerous other awards and accolades, including a Grammy Award, 15 <i>Guinness World Records</i>, six MTV Video Music Awards, seven <i>Billboard</i> Music Awards (including the Millennium Award), the inaugural Radio Disney Icon Award, and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
</p><p>Spears was ranked by <i>Billboard</i> as the eighth-biggest artist of the 2000s. In the United States, she is the fourth best-selling female album artist of the Nielsen SoundScan era as well as the best-selling female album artist of the 2000s.

<p><b>The Doors</b> were an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1965, with vocalist Jim Morrison, keyboardist Ray Manzarek, guitarist Robby Krieger, and drummer John Densmore. They were among the most influential and controversial rock acts of the 1960s, partly due to Morrison's lyrics and voice, along with his erratic stage persona. The group is widely regarded as an important figure of the era's counterculture.</p><p>The band took its name from the title of Aldous Huxley's book <i>The Doors of Perception</i>, itself a reference to a quote by William Blake. After signing with Elektra Records in 1966, the Doors with Morrison recorded and released six studio albums in five years, some of which are generally considered among the greatest of all time, including their self-titled debut (1967), <i>Strange Days</i> (1967), and <i>L.A. Woman</i> (1971). They were one of the most successful bands during that time and by 1972 the Doors had sold over 4 million albums domestically and nearly 8 million singles.</p><p>Morrison died in uncertain circumstances in 1971. The band continued as a trio until disbanding in 1973. They released three more albums in the 1970s, one of which featured earlier recordings by Morrison, and over the decades reunited on stage in various configurations. In 2002, Manzarek, Krieger, and Ian Astbury of the Cult on vocals started performing as ""The Doors of the 21st Century"". Densmore and the Morrison estate successfully sued them over the use of the band's name. After a short time as Riders on the Storm, they settled on the name Manzarek–Krieger and toured until Manzarek's death in 2013.
</p><p>The Doors were the first American band to accumulate eight consecutive gold LPs. According to the RIAA, they have sold 34 million albums in the United States and over 100 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling bands of all time. The Doors have been listed as one of the greatest artists of all time by magazines including <i>Rolling Stone</i>, which ranked them 41st on its list of the ""100 Greatest Artists of All Time"". In 1993, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

<p><b>Madonna Louise Ciccone</b> (<span></span>; <small>Italian: </small><span title=""Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)"" lang=""it-Latn-fonipa"">[tʃikˈkoːne]</span>; born August 16, 1958) is an American singer, songwriter and actress.  Dubbed the ""Queen of Pop"", Madonna has been noted for her continual reinvention and versatility in music production, songwriting, and visual presentation. She has pushed the boundaries of artistic expression in mainstream music, while continuing to maintain control over every aspect of her career. Her works, which incorporate social, political, sexual, and religious themes, have generated both controversy and critical acclaim. A prominent cultural figure crossing both the 20th and 21st centuries, Madonna remains one of the most ""well-documented figures of the modern age"", with a broad amount of scholarly reviews and literature works on her, as well as an academic mini subdiscipline devoted to her named Madonna studies.
</p><p>Madonna moved to New York City in 1978 to pursue a career in modern dance. After performing as a drummer, guitarist, and vocalist in the rock bands Breakfast Club and Emmy, she rose to solo stardom with her debut studio album, <i>Madonna</i> (1983). She followed it with a series of successful albums, including all-time bestsellers <i>Like a Virgin</i> (1984), <i>True Blue</i> (1986) and <i>The Immaculate Collection</i> (1990), as well as Grammy Award winners <i>Ray of Light</i> (1998) and <i>Confessions on a Dance Floor</i> (2005). Madonna has amassed many chart-topping singles throughout her career, including ""Like a Virgin"", ""La Isla Bonita"", ""Like a Prayer"", ""Vogue"", ""Take a Bow"", ""Frozen"", ""Music"", ""Hung Up"", and ""4 Minutes"".
</p><p>Madonna's popularity was enhanced by roles in films such as <i>Desperately Seeking Susan</i> (1985), <i>Dick Tracy</i> (1990), <i>A League of Their Own</i> (1992), and <i>Evita</i> (1996). While <i>Evita</i> won her a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress, many of her other films were not as well received. As a businesswoman, Madonna founded the company Maverick in 1992. It included Maverick Records, one of the most successful artist-run labels in history. Her other ventures include fashion brands, written works, health clubs, and filmmaking. She contributes to various charities, having founded the Ray of Light Foundation in 1998 and Raising Malawi in 2006.
</p><p>With sales of over 300 million records worldwide, Madonna is the best-selling female recording artist of all time. She is the most successful solo artist in the history of the U.S. <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 chart and has achieved the most number-one singles by a woman in Australia, Canada, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom. With a revenue of over U.S. $1.5 billion from her concert tickets, she remains the highest-grossing female touring artist worldwide. <i>Forbes</i> has named Madonna the annual top-earning female musician a record 11 times across four decades (1980s–2010s). She was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2008, her first year of eligibility. Madonna was ranked as the greatest woman in music by VH1, and as the greatest music video artist ever by MTV and <i>Billboard</i>. <i>Rolling Stone</i> also listed her among its greatest artists and greatest songwriters of all time.

Since 2001, the band has consisted of Rivers Cuomo (vocals, guitar, keyboards), Patrick Wilson (drums, backing vocals), Scott Shriner (bass guitar, keyboards, backing vocals), and Brian Bell (guitar, keyboards, backing vocals).
</p><p>After signing to Geffen Records in 1993, Weezer released their self-titled debut album, also known as the Blue Album, in May 1994. Backed by music videos for the singles ""Buddy Holly"", ""Undone – The Sweater Song"", and ""Say It Ain't So"", the Blue Album became a multiplatinum success. Weezer's second album, <i>Pinkerton</i> (1996), featuring a darker, more abrasive sound, was a commercial failure and initially received mixed reviews, but achieved cult status and critical acclaim years later. Both the Blue Album and <i>Pinkerton</i> are now frequently cited among the best albums of the 1990s. Following the tour for <i>Pinkerton</i>, founding bassist Matt Sharp left the band and Weezer went on hiatus.
</p><p>In 2001, Weezer returned with the Green Album with their new bassist, Mikey Welsh. With a more pop sound, and promoted by singles ""Hash Pipe"" and ""Island in the Sun"", it was a commercial success and received mostly positive reviews. After the Green Album tour, Welsh left for health reasons and was replaced by Shriner. Weezer's fourth album, <i>Maladroit</i> (2002), incorporated a hard-rock sound and achieved mostly positive reviews, but weaker sales. <i>Make Believe</i> (2005) received mixed reviews, but its single ""Beverly Hills"" became Weezer's first single to top the US Modern Rock Tracks chart and their first to reach the top ten on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100.
</p><p>In 2008, Weezer released the Red Album; its lead single, ""Pork and Beans"", became the third Weezer song to top the Modern Rock Tracks chart, backed by a Grammy-winning music video. <i>Raditude</i> (2009) and <i>Hurley</i> (2010) featured more ""modern pop production"" and songs co-written with other artists, achieved further mixed reviews and moderate sales. <i>Everything Will Be Alright in the End</i> (2014) and the White Album (2016) returned to a rock style that was reminiscent of their 90s sound mixed with modern alternative production and achieved more positive reviews; <i>Pacific Daydream</i> (2017) featured a more mainstream pop sound. In 2019, Weezer released an album of covers, the Teal Album, followed by the Black Album. In 2021, they released <i>OK Human</i>, which featured an orchestral pop sound and was met with critical acclaim, followed by the hard rock–inspired <i>Van Weezer</i>.

<p><b>Snow Patrol</b> are a Northern Irish–Scottish rock band formed in 1994 in Dundee, Scotland. They consist of Gary Lightbody (vocals, guitar), Nathan Connolly (guitar, backing vocals), Paul Wilson (bass guitar, backing vocals), Jonny Quinn (drums), and Johnny McDaid (piano, guitar, backing vocals). Initially an indie rock band, Snow Patrol rose to prominence in the early– mid-2000s as part of the post-Britpop movement.
</p><p>The band were founded at the University of Dundee in 1994 by Lightbody, Mark McClelland, and Michael Morrison of Shrug. After briefly using the name Polarbear, releasing the EP <i>Starfighter Pilot</i> (1997) and losing Morrison as a member, the band became Snow Patrol in 1997 and added Quinn to its lineup. Their first two studio albums, <i>Songs for Polarbears</i> (1998) and <i>When It's All Over We Still Have to Clear Up</i> (2001), released by the independent record label Jeepster Records, were commercially unsuccessful. The band then signed to the major record label Polydor Records in 2002.
</p><p>Connolly joined Snow Patrol in 2002, and after their major-label debut album, <i>Final Straw</i>, the following year, with ""Run"", the album's biggest hit, the band rose to national fame. The album was certified 5× platinum in the UK. Their next studio album, <i>Eyes Open</i> (2006), and its hit single, ""Chasing Cars""—reported in 2019 to be the most-played song of the 21st century on UK radio—propelled the band to greater international fame. The album topped the UK Albums Chart and was the best-selling British album of the year. In 2008, Snow Patrol released their fifth studio album, <i>A Hundred Million Suns</i>; then, in 2009, they released their first compilation album, <i>Up to Now</i>; and, in 2011, their sixth studio album, <i>Fallen Empires</i>, was published. The band released their seventh album, <i>Wildness</i>, on 25 May 2018.
</p><p>During the course of their career, Snow Patrol have won seven Meteor Ireland Music Awards and been nominated for six Brit Awards and one Grammy. <i>Final Straw</i>, <i>Eyes Open</i>, and <i>A Hundred Million Suns</i> have sold ten million copies worldwide, combined.</p>

</p>
<p><b>Blink-182</b> (stylized as <b>blink-182</b>) is an American rock band formed in Poway, California in 1992. Their current lineup consists of bassist/vocalist Mark Hoppus, guitarist/vocalist Tom DeLonge, and drummer Travis Barker. Though their sound has diversified throughout their career, their musical style, described as pop-punk, blends catchy pop melodies with fast-paced punk rock. Their lyrics center on relationships, adolescent frustration, and maturity—or lack thereof. The group emerged from a suburban, Southern California skate-punk scene and gained notoriety for high-energy live shows and irreverent humor.
</p><p>After years of independent recording and touring, including stints on the Warped Tour, the group signed to MCA Records. Their biggest albums, <i>Enema of the State</i> (1999) and <i>Take Off Your Pants and Jacket</i> (2001), saw international success. Songs like ""All the Small Things"", ""Dammit"", ""I Miss You"", and ""What's My Age Again?"" became hit singles and MTV staples. Later efforts, including an untitled album (2003), marked stylistic shifts. Hoppus is the only member to remain in the band throughout its entire history. DeLonge left the group twice, both times a decade apart, before eventually returning. Founding drummer Scott Raynor recorded and toured with the group before being dismissed in 1998, with Barker taking his place from that point on. From 2015 to 2022, the band included Alkaline Trio singer/guitarist Matt Skiba, with whom they recorded two albums, <i>California</i> (2016) and <i>Nine</i> (2019) and toured in support of both.
</p><p>Blink-182's straightforward approach and simple arrangements, which helped initiate pop-punk's mainstream rise, made them popular among generations of listeners. Worldwide, the group has sold 50 million albums and moved 13 million copies in the U.S.</p>

<p><b>The White Stripes</b> were an American rock duo from Detroit formed in 1997. The group consisted of Jack White (songwriter, vocals, guitar, piano, and mandolin) and Meg White (drums and vocals). After releasing several singles and three albums within the Detroit music scene, the White Stripes rose to prominence in 2002 as part of the garage rock revival scene. Their successful and critically acclaimed albums <i>White Blood Cells</i> and <i>Elephant</i> drew attention from a large variety of media outlets in the United States and the United Kingdom. The single ""Seven Nation Army"", which used a guitar and an octave pedal to create the opening riff, became one of their most recognizable songs. The band recorded two more albums, <i>Get Behind Me Satan</i> in 2005 and <i>Icky Thump</i> in 2007, and dissolved in 2011 after a lengthy hiatus from performing and recording.</p><p>The White Stripes used a low-fidelity approach to writing and recording. Their music featured a melding of garage rock and blues influences and a raw simplicity of composition, arrangement, and performance. The duo were also noted for their fashion and design aesthetic which featured a simple color scheme of red, white, and black—which was used on every album and single cover the band released—as well as the band's fascination with the number three. The band's discography consists of six studio albums, two live albums, one extended play (EP), one concert film, one tour documentary, 26 singles, and 14 music videos. Their last three albums each won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album. In 2015, <i>Rolling Stone</i> named them the sixth greatest duo of all time.</p>",Detroit

Throughout numerous lineup changes since the band's formation, guitarist, lead vocalist, and songwriter Robert Smith has remained the only constant member. The band's debut album, <i>Three Imaginary Boys</i> (1979), along with several early singles, placed the band in the post-punk and new wave movements that had sprung up in the United Kingdom. Beginning with their second album, <i>Seventeen Seconds</i> (1980), the band adopted a new, increasingly dark and tormented style, which, together with Smith's stage look, had a strong influence on the emerging genre of gothic rock as well as the subculture that eventually formed around the genre.
</p><p>After the release of the band's fourth album, <i>Pornography</i> (1982), Smith introduced a greater pop sensibility into the band's music, and they subsequently garnered worldwide mainstream success. Their singles compilation <i>Standing on a Beach</i> (1986) sold four million copies worldwide by 1989, and they reached their commercial peak with the albums <i>Disintegration</i> (1989) and <i>Wish</i> (1992). The Cure have released 13 studio albums, two EPs, over 30 singles, and have sold over 30 million albums worldwide. Their most recent album, <i>4:13 Dream</i>, was released in 2008.
The Cure were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2019.</p>",Crawley

</p>
<p><b>Aerosmith</b> is an American rock band formed in Boston in 1970. The group consists of Steven Tyler (lead vocals, harmonica, piano), Joe Perry (guitar), Tom Hamilton (bass), Joey Kramer (drums) and Brad Whitford (guitar). Their style, which is rooted in blues-based hard rock, has also incorporated elements of pop rock, heavy metal, glam metal, and rhythm and blues, and has inspired many subsequent rock artists. They are sometimes referred to as ""the Bad Boys from Boston"" and ""America's Greatest Rock and Roll Band"". The primary songwriting team of Tyler and Perry is often known as the ""Toxic Twins"".
</p><p>Perry and Hamilton, originally in a band together called the Jam Band, met up with Tyler, Kramer, and guitarist Ray Tabano, and formed Aerosmith; in 1971, Tabano was replaced by Whitford. They released a string of multi-platinum albums starting with their eponymous debut in 1973, followed by <i>Get Your Wings</i> in 1974. The band broke into the mainstream with <i>Toys in the Attic</i> (1975) and <i>Rocks</i> (1976). <i>Draw the Line</i> and <i>Night in the Ruts</i> followed in 1977 and 1979. Throughout the 1970s, the band toured extensively and charted a dozen Hot 100 singles, including their first Top 40 hit ""Sweet Emotion"" and the Top 10 hits ""Dream On"" and ""Walk This Way"". By the end of the decade, they were among the most popular hard rock bands in the world and developed a following of fans, often referred to as the ""Blue Army"". Drug addiction and internal conflict led to the departures of Perry and Whitford in 1979 and 1981.
The band did not fare well and the album <i>Rock in a Hard Place</i> (1982) failed to match previous successes.
</p><p>Perry and Whitford returned to Aerosmith in 1984. After a comeback tour, they recorded <i>Done with Mirrors</i> (1985), which did not meet commercial expectations. It was not until a 1986 collaboration with rap group Run–D.M.C. on a remake of ""Walk This Way"", and the 1987 multi-platinum release, <i>Permanent Vacation</i>, that they regained their previous level of popularity. In the late 1980s and 1990s, the band won numerous awards for music from the multi-platinum albums <i>Pump</i> (1989), <i>Get a Grip</i> (1993), and <i>Nine Lives</i> (1997), while they embarked on their most extensive concert tours to date. Their biggest hits during this period included ""Dude (Looks Like a Lady)"", ""Angel"", ""Rag Doll"", ""Love in an Elevator"", ""Janie's Got a Gun"", ""What it Takes"", ""Livin' on the Edge"", ""Cryin'"", and ""Crazy"". The band also filmed popular music videos and made notable appearances in television, film, and video games. In 1998, they achieved their first number-one hit with ""I Don't Want to Miss a Thing"" from <i>Armageddon'</i>s soundtrack and the following year, their roller coaster attraction opened at Walt Disney World. Their comeback has been described as one of the most remarkable and spectacular in rock history. Additional albums <i>Just Push Play</i> (which included the hit ""Jaded""), <i>Honkin' on Bobo</i> (a collection of blues covers), and <i>Music from Another Dimension!</i> followed in 2001, 2004, and 2012. In 2008, they released <i>Guitar Hero: Aerosmith</i>, which is considered to be the best-selling band-centric video game. After five decades, the band continues to tour and record music. From 2019–2022, the band had a concert residency in Las Vegas, which was interrupted from 2020–2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
</p><p>Aerosmith is the best-selling American hard rock band of all time, having sold more than 150 million records worldwide, including over 85 million records in the United States. With 25 gold, 18 platinum, and 12 multi-platinum albums, they hold the record for the most total certifications by an American group and are tied for the most multi-platinum albums by an American group. They have achieved twenty-one Top 40 hits on the US Hot 100, nine number-one Mainstream Rock hits, four Grammy Awards, six American Music Awards, and ten MTV Video Music Awards. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001, and were ranked number 57 and 30, respectively, on <i>Rolling Stone</i><span>'</span>s and VH1's lists of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. In 2013, Tyler and Perry were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and in 2020, the band received the MusiCares Person of the Year award.

</p>
<p><b>The Offspring</b> is an American rock band from Garden Grove, California, formed in 1984. Originally formed under the name <b>Manic Subsidal</b>, the band's current lineup consists of lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Bryan ""Dexter"" Holland, lead guitarist Kevin ""Noodles"" Wasserman and bassist Todd Morse. Over the course of their <span></span>39-year career, the Offspring has released ten studio albums and have also experienced a number of lineup changes, most notably with their drummer. Their longest-serving drummer was Ron Welty, who replaced original drummer James Lilja in 1987 and stayed with the Offspring for 16 years. Welty was replaced by Atom Willard in 2003, who was replaced four years later by Pete Parada, who remained as the drummer for the Offspring until he was fired from the band in 2021 for refusing to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Gregory ""Greg K."" Kriesel (one of the Offspring's cofounders) was their bassist until 2018, when he was fired from the band due to business disputes, thus leaving Holland as the sole remaining original member. Kriesel was replaced by Todd Morse of H<sub>2</sub>O, who had been the Offspring's touring guitarist since 2009.</p><p>The Offspring is often credited—alongside fellow California punk bands Green Day, NOFX, Bad Religion and Rancid—for reviving mainstream interest in punk rock in the 1990s. They have sold over 40 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling punk rock bands in history.</p><p>After achieving a local following with their early releases, including their 1989 self-titled debut album and the vinyl-only EP <i>Baghdad</i> (1991), the Offspring signed with independent label Epitaph Records and released two albums: <i>Ignition</i> (1992) and <i>Smash</i> (1994). <i>Smash</i>, which contained the band's first major hit ""Come Out and Play"", propelled punk rock into the mainstream and holds the distinction as one of the best-selling albums released on an independent record label, selling over 11 million copies worldwide. The success of <i>Smash</i> attracted attention from major labels including Columbia Records, with whom The Offspring signed in 1996; their first album for the label, <i>Ixnay on the Hombre</i> (1997), did not match its predecessor’s success, but received favorable reviews and gold and platinum RIAA certifications. The band's fifth album <i>Americana</i> (1998) regained their previous level of popularity, obtaining support from MTV and radio and selling over five million units in the US. The Offspring has since released five more albums: <i>Conspiracy of One</i> (2000); <i>Splinter</i> (2003); <i>Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace</i> (2008); <i>Days Go By</i> (2012); and <i>Let the Bad Times Roll</i> (2021).

</p>
<p><b>Metallica</b> is an American heavy metal band. The band was formed in 1981 in Los Angeles by vocalist/guitarist James Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich, and has been based in San Francisco for most of its career. The band's fast tempos, instrumentals and aggressive musicianship made them one of the founding ""big four"" bands of thrash metal, alongside Megadeth, Anthrax and Slayer. Metallica's current lineup comprises founding members and primary songwriters Hetfield and Ulrich, longtime lead guitarist Kirk Hammett and bassist Robert Trujillo. Guitarist Dave Mustaine, who formed Megadeth after being fired from the band, and bassists Ron McGovney, Cliff Burton and Jason Newsted are former members of the band.
</p><p>Metallica first found commercial success with the release of its third album, <i>Master of Puppets</i> (1986), which is cited as one of the heaviest metal albums and the band's best work. The band's next album, <i>...And Justice for All</i> (1988), gave Metallica its first Grammy Award nomination. Its self-titled fifth album, <i>Metallica</i> (1991), was the band's first not to root predominantly in thrash metal; it appealed to a more mainstream audience, achieving substantial commercial success and selling over 16 million copies in the United States to date, making it the best-selling album of the SoundScan era. After experimenting with different genres and directions in subsequent releases, Metallica returned to its thrash metal roots with the release of its ninth album, <i>Death Magnetic</i> (2008), which drew similar praise to that of the band's earlier albums. This was followed by the band's 10th studio album, <i>Hardwired... to Self-Destruct</i> (2016), with its 11th album, <i>72 Seasons</i>, set for release in 2023.
</p><p>In 2000, Metallica led the case against the peer-to-peer file sharing service Napster, in which the band and several other artists filed lawsuits against the service for sharing their copyright-protected material without consent, eventually reaching a settlement. Metallica was the subject of the acclaimed 2004 documentary film <i>Metallica: Some Kind of Monster</i>, which documented the troubled production of the band's eighth album, <i>St. Anger</i> (2003), and the internal struggles within the band at the time. In 2009, Metallica was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The band co-wrote the screenplay for and starred alongside Dane DeHaan in the 2013 concert film <i>Metallica: Through the Never</i>, in which the band performed live against a fictional thriller storyline.
</p><p>Metallica has released 10 studio albums, four live albums (including two performances with the San Francisco Symphony), 12 video albums, a cover album, two extended plays, 37 singles and 39 music videos. The band has won nine Grammy Awards from 23 nominations, and its last six studio albums (beginning with <i>Metallica</i>) have consecutively debuted at No. 1 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200. Metallica ranks as one of the most commercially successful bands of all time, having sold over 125 million albums worldwide as of 2018. Metallica has been listed as one of the greatest artists of all time by magazines such as <i>Rolling Stone</i>, which ranked the band No. 61 on its <i>100 Greatest Artists of All Time</i> list. As of 2017, Metallica is the third-best-selling music artist since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales in 1991, selling a total of 58 million albums in the United States.</p>",

One of the first alternative rock bands, R.E.M. was noted for Buck's ringing, arpeggiated guitar style; Stipe's distinctive vocal quality, unique stage presence, and obscure lyrics; Mills's melodic bass lines and backing vocals; and Berry's tight, economical drumming style. In the early 1990s, other alternative rock acts such as Nirvana and Pavement viewed R.E.M. as a pioneer of the genre. After Berry left the band in 1997, the band continued its career in the 2000s with mixed critical and commercial success. The band broke up amicably in 2011 with members devoting time to solo projects after having sold more than 90 million albums worldwide and becoming one of the world's best-selling music acts.
</p><p>R.E.M. released its first single, ""Radio Free Europe"", in 1981 on the independent record label Hib-Tone. It was followed by the <i>Chronic Town</i> EP in 1982, the band's first release on I.R.S. Records. In 1983, the group released its critically acclaimed debut album, <i>Murmur</i>, and built its reputation over the next few years with similarly acclaimed releases every year from 1984 to 1988: <i>Reckoning</i>, <i>Fables of the Reconstruction</i>, <i>Lifes Rich Pageant</i>, <i>Document</i> and <i>Green</i>, including an intermittent b-side compilation <i>Dead Letter Office</i>. Don Dixon and Mitch Easter produced their first two albums, Joe Boyd handled production on <i>Fables of the Reconstruction</i> and Don Gehman produced <i>Lifes Rich Pageant.</i> Thereafter, R.E.M. settled on Scott Litt as producer for the next 10<span> </span>years during the band's most successful period of their career. They also started co-producing their material and playing other instruments in the studio apart from the main ones they play. With constant touring, and the support of college radio following years of underground success, R.E.M. achieved a mainstream hit with the 1987 single ""The One I Love"". The group signed to Warner Bros. Records in 1988, and began to espouse political and environmental concerns while playing large arenas worldwide. They have since stated that the band was unlikely to reunite in several interviews.
</p><p>R.E.M.'s most commercially successful albums, <i>Out of Time</i> (1991) and <i>Automatic for the People</i> (1992), put them in the vanguard of alternative rock just as it was becoming mainstream. <i>Out of Time</i> received seven nominations at the 34th Annual Grammy Awards, and lead single ""Losing My Religion"", was R.E.M.'s highest-charting and best-selling hit. <i>Monster</i> (1994) continued its run of success. The band began its first tour in six years to support the album; the tour was marred by medical emergencies suffered by three of the band members. In 1996, R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. for a reported US$80 million, at the time the most expensive recording contract ever. The tour was productive and the band recorded the following album mostly during soundchecks. The resulting record, <i>New Adventures in Hi-Fi</i> (1996), is hailed as the band's last great album and the members' favorite, growing in cult status over the years. Berry left the band the following year, and Stipe, Buck, and Mills continued as a musical trio, supplemented by studio and live musicians, such as multi-instrumentalists Scott McCaughey and Ken Stringfellow and drummers Joey Waronker and Bill Rieflin. They also parted ways with their longtime manager Jefferson Holt and band's attorney Bertis Downs assumed managerial duties. Seeking to also renovate their sound, the band stopped working with Scott Litt, co-producer and contributor to six of their studio albums and hired Pat McCarthy as co-producer, who had participated before that as mixer and engineer on their last two albums.
</p><p>After the electronic experimental direction of <i>Up</i> (1998) that was commercially unsuccessful, <i>Reveal</i> (2001) was referred to as ""a conscious return to their classic sound"" which received general acclaim. In 2007, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, in its first year of eligibility and Berry reunited with the band for the ceremony and to record a cover of John Lennon's ""#9 Dream"" for the compilation album <i>Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur</i> to benefit Amnesty International's campaign to alleviate the Darfur conflict. Looking for a change of sound after lukewarm reception for <i>Around the Sun</i> (2004), the band collaborated with co-producer Jacknife Lee on their last two studio albums—the well-received <i>Accelerate</i> (2008) and <i>Collapse into Now</i> (2011)—as well as their first live albums after decades of touring. R.E.M. disbanded amicably in September 2011, with former members having continued with various musical projects, and several live and archival albums have since been released.

</p>
<p><b>Blur</b> are an English rock band formed in London in 1988. The band consists of singer Damon Albarn, guitarist Graham Coxon, bassist Alex James and drummer Dave Rowntree. Their debut album, <i>Leisure</i> (1991), incorporated the sounds of Madchester and shoegazing. Following a stylistic change influenced by English guitar pop groups such as the Kinks, the Beatles and XTC, Blur released <i>Modern Life Is Rubbish</i> (1993), <i>Parklife</i> (1994) and <i>The Great Escape</i> (1995). As a result, the band helped to popularise the Britpop genre and achieved mass popularity in the UK, aided by a chart battle with rival band Oasis in 1995 dubbed ""The Battle of Britpop"".
</p><p>Blur's self-titled fifth album (1997) saw another stylistic shift, influenced by the lo-fi styles of American indie rock groups, and became their third UK chart-topping album. Its single ""Song 2"" brought the band mainstream success in the US for the first time. Their next album, <i>13</i> (1999) saw the band experimenting with electronic and gospel music, and featured more personal lyrics from Albarn. Their seventh album, <i>Think Tank</i> (2003), continued their experimentation with electronic sounds and was also shaped by Albarn's growing interest in hip hop and world music, featuring more minimal guitar work. Coxon left the band during early recording sessions for <i>Think Tank</i>, and Blur disbanded for several years after the end of the album's associated tour, with the members engaged in other projects.
</p><p>In 2009, Blur reunited with Coxon back in the band and embarked on a European reunion tour. In the following years, they released several singles and compilations and toured internationally. In 2012, they received a Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. Their eighth album, <i>The Magic Whip</i> (2015), was the sixth consecutive Blur studio album to top the British chart. The group were largely on hiatus between the end of <i>the Magic Whip</i> tour and the announcement of a series of concert dates for 2023.

<p><b>Rage Against the Machine</b> (often abbreviated as <b>RATM</b> or shortened to simply <b>Rage</b>) is an American rock band from Los Angeles, California. Formed in 1991, the group consists of vocalist Zack de la Rocha, bassist and backing vocalist Tim Commerford, guitarist Tom Morello, and drummer Brad Wilk. The band are known for their melding of heavy metal and rap music with punk rock and funk influences, and their revolutionary socialist political views. As of 2010, they have sold over 16 million records worldwide. The band was nominated for induction into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in their first year of eligibility in 2017, then again in 2018, 2019, and 2021, though the bids failed.</p><p>Rage Against the Machine released its self-titled debut album in 1992 to critical acclaim, and achieved commercial success following their performances at the 1993 Lollapalooza festival; in 2003, the album was ranked number 368 on <i>Rolling Stone's</i> list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. The band's next two albums, <i>Evil Empire</i> (1996) and <i>The Battle of Los Angeles</i> (1999), were also successful; both albums topped the <i>Billboard</i> 200 chart. During their initial nine-year run, Rage Against the Machine became a popular and influential band, and had a large influence on the nu metal genre which came to prominence during the late 1990s and early 2000s. They were also ranked No. 33 on VH1's <i>100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock</i>.</p><p>In 2000, Rage Against the Machine released the cover album <i>Renegades</i> and disbanded after growing creative differences led to De la Rocha's departure. De la Rocha started a low-profile solo career, while the rest of the band formed the rock supergroup Audioslave with Chris Cornell, the former frontman of Soundgarden; Audioslave recorded three albums before disbanding in 2007. The same year, Rage Against the Machine announced a reunion and performed together for the first time in seven years at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in April 2007. Within the next four years, minus a sabbatical in 2009, the band continued to perform at more live venues and festivals around the world before going on hiatus once again in 2011. In 2016, Morello, Commerford and Wilk formed a new band, Prophets of Rage, with B-Real, Chuck D, and DJ Lord; that band released one EP and one full-length studio album before disbanding in 2019.
</p><p>After an eight-year hiatus, Rage Against the Machine announced in November 2019 that they were reuniting for a world tour, which was initially scheduled to start in 2020, but was ultimately postponed to 2021, and then to 2022, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

<p><b>Justin Randall Timberlake</b> (born January 31, 1981) is an American singer, songwriter, and actor. He is one of the world's best-selling music artists, with sales of over 88 million records. Timberlake is the recipient of numerous awards and accolades, including ten Grammy Awards, four Primetime Emmy Awards, three Brit Awards, nine <i>Billboard</i> Music Awards, the Contemporary Icon Award by the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award. According to <i>Billboard</i>, he is the best performing male soloist in the history of the Mainstream Top 40.
</p><p>Born and raised in Memphis, Tennessee, as a child he appeared on the television shows <i>Star Search</i> and <i>The All-New Mickey Mouse Club</i>. In the late 1990s, Timberlake rose to prominence as one of the two lead vocalists and youngest member of NSYNC, which eventually became one of the best-selling boy bands of all time. Timberlake won two Grammy Awards for his R&amp;B-focused debut solo album <i>Justified</i> (2002) and its single ""Cry Me a River"". Another single from the album, ""Rock Your Body"", was also successful.
</p><p>His critically acclaimed second album <i>FutureSex/LoveSounds</i> (2006), characterized by its diversity in music genres, debuted atop the U.S. <i>Billboard</i> 200 and spawned the Hot 100 consecutive number-one singles with ""SexyBack"" (featuring Timbaland), ""My Love"" (featuring T.I.), and ""What Goes Around... Comes Around"". Established as a solo artist worldwide, his first two albums both exceeded sales of 10 million copies, as he continued producing records and collaborating with other artists.

</p><p>Timberlake resumed his music career in 2013 with his third and fourth albums <i>The 20/20 Experience</i> and <i>The 20/20 Experience – 2 of 2</i>, exploring neo soul styles, partly inspired by the expansive song structures of 1960s and 1970s rock.

Timberlake voiced Branch in DreamWorks Animation's <i>Trolls</i> (2016), whose soundtrack includes his fifth <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 chart-topping single, ""Can't Stop the Feeling!"", which earned him an Academy Award nomination. His fifth studio album <i>Man of the Woods</i> (2018) became his fourth number-one album in the US. Supported by the two top ten singles, ""Filthy"" and ""Say Something"" (featuring Chris Stapleton), it concluded 2018 as the sixth best-selling album of the year.</p>",

<p><b>The Smashing Pumpkins</b> (also referred to as simply <b>Smashing Pumpkins</b>) are an American alternative rock band from Chicago. Formed in 1988 by frontman and guitarist Billy Corgan, bassist D'arcy Wretzky, guitarist  James Iha and drummer Jimmy Chamberlin, the band has undergone several line-up changes since their reunion in 2006, with Corgan being the sole constant member since its inception. The current lineup features Corgan, Chamberlin, Iha and guitarist Jeff Schroeder.
</p><p>Disavowing the punk rock roots of many of their contemporaries, they have a diverse, densely-layered sound, containing elements of gothic rock, heavy metal, dream pop, psychedelic rock, progressive rock, shoegaze, and electronica in later recordings. Corgan is the group's primary composer; his musical versatility and cathartic lyrics have shaped the band's distinctive albums, which one writer described as ""anguished, bruised reports from Billy Corgan's nightmare-land"". With 30 million albums sold worldwide, the Smashing Pumpkins were one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands of the 1990s, often cited as an important act in the popularization of alternative rock music. However, internal conflicts, drug use, and diminishing sales led to a break-up in 2000.
</p><p>In 2006, Corgan and Chamberlin reconvened to record a new Smashing Pumpkins album, <i>Zeitgeist</i>. After touring throughout 2007 and 2008 with a lineup including new guitarist Jeff Schroeder, Chamberlin left the band in early 2009. Later that year, Corgan began a new recording series with a rotating lineup of musicians entitled <i>Teargarden by Kaleidyscope</i>, which encompassed stand-alone singles, EP releases, and two full albums that also fell under the project's scope—<i>Oceania</i> in 2012 and <i>Monuments to an Elegy</i> in 2014. Chamberlin and Iha officially rejoined the band in February 2018. The reunited lineup released the album <i>Shiny and Oh So Bright, Vol. 1 / LP: No Past. No Future. No Sun.</i> (2018),  <i>Cyr</i> (2020) and is scheduled to release <i>Atum: A Rock Opera in Three Acts</i> in three increments across 2022 and 2023.

</p>
<p><b>John R. Cash</b> (born <b>J. R. Cash</b>; February 26, 1932 – September 12, 2003) was an American country singer-songwriter. Much of Cash's music contained themes of sorrow, moral tribulation, and redemption, especially in the later stages of his career. He was known for his deep, calm bass-baritone voice, the distinctive sound of his Tennessee Three backing band characterized by train-like chugging guitar rhythms, a rebelliousness coupled with an increasingly somber and humble demeanor, free prison concerts, and a trademark all-black stage wardrobe, which earned him the nickname the ""<b>Man in Black</b>"".</p><p>Born to poor cotton farmers in Kingsland, Arkansas, Cash rose to fame during the mid-1950s in the burgeoning rockabilly scene in Memphis, Tennessee, after four years in the Air Force. He traditionally began his concerts by simply introducing himself, ""Hello, I'm Johnny Cash"", followed by ""Folsom Prison Blues"", one of his signature songs. His other signature songs include ""I Walk the Line"", ""Ring of Fire"", ""Get Rhythm"", and ""Man in Black"". He also recorded humorous numbers like ""One Piece at a Time"" and ""A Boy Named Sue"", a duet with his future wife June called ""Jackson"" (followed by many further duets after their wedding), and railroad songs such as ""Hey, Porter"", ""Orange Blossom Special"", and ""Rock Island Line"". During the last stage of his career, he covered songs by contemporary rock artists; among his most notable covers were ""Hurt"" by Nine Inch Nails, ""Rusty Cage"" by Soundgarden, and ""Personal Jesus"" by Depeche Mode.
</p><p>Cash is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 90 million records worldwide. His genre-spanning music embraced country, rock and roll, rockabilly, blues, folk, and gospel sounds. This crossover appeal earned him the rare honor of being inducted into the Country Music, Rock and Roll, and Gospel Music Halls of Fame. His music career was dramatized in the 2005 biopic <i>Walk the Line</i>, in which Cash was portrayed by American film actor Joaquin Phoenix.

<p><b>Christina María Aguilera</b> (<span></span>; <small>Spanish: </small><span title=""Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)"" lang=""es-Latn-fonipa"">[aɣiˈleɾa]</span>; born December 18, 1980) is an American singer, songwriter, actress, and television personality. Known for her four-octave vocal range and ability to sustain high notes, she has been referred to as the ""Voice of a Generation"". Her works, which incorporate feminism, sexuality, and domestic violence, have generated both critical praise and controversy, for which she is often cited as an influence by other artists. 
</p><p>After appearing in several television programs as a child, Aguilera rose to prominence in 1999 with the release of her debut album, <i>Christina Aguilera</i>, through RCA Records. The album spawned three <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 number-one singles — ""Genie in a Bottle"", ""What a Girl Wants"" and ""Come On Over Baby (All I Want Is You)"" — and earned her the Grammy Award for Best New Artist. The album's musical direction is credited with influencing the revival of teen pop in the late 1990s and early 2000s, while its Spanish-language follow up, <i>Mi Reflejo</i> (2000), is noted for contributing to the 2000s Latin pop boom. Displeased with the nature of her earlier work, Aguilera assumed artistic control of her fourth studio album, <i>Stripped</i> (2002). The music video for the album's lead single ""Dirrty"" sparked controversy for exploring her sexuality, leading to the departure of her teen idol image. However, further singles ""Beautiful"", ""Fighter"" and ""Can't Hold Us Down"" became top-ten singles in many countries, and she was named the most successful female artist of 2003.
</p><p>Her fifth album, <i>Back to Basics</i> (2006), was met with favorable reviews and became the second of her career to debut atop of the <i>Billboard</i> 200. Its singles ""Ain't No Other Man"", ""Candyman"" and ""Hurt"" reached the top-ten positions in most countries. In 2010, Aguilera starred in <i>Burlesque</i> and contributed to its soundtrack. In subsequent years, she featured on the successful singles ""Feel This Moment"", ""Say Something"", and ""Moves Like Jagger"". The latter reached number one on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 making Aguilera one of the few artists to reach the top spot over three decades. Outside of her music, she was named a spokesperson for the World Food Program (WFP), served as a coach on reality competition show <i>The Voice</i> (2011–2016), and acted in the drama series <i>Nashville</i> (2015).
</p><p>Aguilera is considered a pop culture icon and is generally described as a triple threat entertainer. With estimated sales over 90 million records, she is recognized as one of the world's best-selling music artists. In 2009, she was classified as the twentieth most successful artist of the 2000s by <i>Billboard</i>. Throughout her career, she has accumulated numerous awards and accolades, including five Grammy Awards, two Latin Grammy Awards, two MTV Video Music Awards (VMA), one <i>Billboard</i> Music Award, one Guinness World Record, a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and was named a Disney Legend. Aguilera is regarded as one of the most influential Latin artists in the entertainment industry; in 2013, <i>Time</i> listed her among the 100 most influential people in the world, and was ranked as the eighth greatest woman in music by VH1. Furthermore, she has been deemed one of the greatest singers in contemporary pop music, ranked among the greatest of all time by magazines such as <i>Rolling Stone</i> and <i>Consequence of Sound</i>.

</p>
<p><b>The Who</b> are an English rock band formed in London in 1964. Their core lineup consisted of lead vocalist Roger Daltrey, guitarist Pete Townshend, bassist John Entwistle and drummer Keith Moon. They are considered one of the most influential rock bands of the 20th century, and have sold over 100 million records worldwide. Their contributions to rock music include the development of the Marshall Stack, large PA systems, the use of the synthesizer, Entwistle and Moon's influential playing styles, Townshend's feedback and power chord guitar technique, and the development of the rock opera. They are cited as an influence by many hard rock, punk, power pop and mod bands, and their songs are still regularly played. The Who were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990. 
</p><p>The Who developed from an earlier group, the Detours, and established themselves as part of the pop art and mod movements, featuring auto-destructive art by destroying guitars and drums on stage. Their first single as the Who, ""I Can't Explain"" (1965), reached the UK top ten, and was followed by a string of hit singles including ""My Generation"" (1965), ""Substitute"" (1966) and ""Happy Jack"" (1966). In 1967, they performed at the Monterey Pop Festival and released ""I Can See for Miles"", their only US top-ten single. The group's 1969 concept album <i>Tommy</i> included the single ""Pinball Wizard"" and was a critical and commercial success.
</p><p>Further festival appearances at Woodstock and the Isle of Wight, along with the concert album <i>Live at Leeds</i> (1970), established their reputation as a respected rock act. The success put pressure on lead songwriter Townshend, and the follow-up to <i>Tommy</i>, <i>Lifehouse</i>, was abandoned. Songs from the project made up <i>Who's Next</i> (1971), including the hits ""Won't Get Fooled Again"", ""Baba O'Riley"", and ""Behind Blue Eyes"". The group released another concept album, <i>Quadrophenia</i> (1973), as a celebration of their mod roots, and oversaw the film adaptation of <i>Tommy</i> (1975). They continued to tour to large audiences before semi-retiring from live performances at the end of 1976. Unfortunately, the release of <i>Who Are You</i> (1978) was overshadowed by Moon's death shortly after.
</p><p>Kenney Jones replaced Moon and the group resumed touring, and released a film adaptation of <i>Quadrophenia</i> and the retrospective documentary <i>The Kids Are Alright</i>. After Townshend became weary of the group, they split in 1983. The Who occasionally re-formed for live appearances such as Live Aid in 1985, a 25th-anniversary tour in 1989 and a tour of <i>Quadrophenia</i> in 1996–1997. A full reunion began in 1999, with drummer Zak Starkey. After Entwistle's death in 2002, plans for a new album were delayed until 2006, with <i>Endless Wire</i>.  Since Entwistle's death, the Who have continued to perform and tour, most commonly with Starkey on drums, Pino Palladino on bass, and Pete's brother Simon Townshend on second guitar and backing vocals. In 2019, the group released the album <i>Who</i> and toured with a symphony orchestra.

</p>

<p><b>James Marshall</b> ""<b>Jimi</b>"" <b>Hendrix</b> (born <b>Johnny Allen Hendrix</b>; November 27, 1942 – September 18, 1970) was an American guitarist, singer and songwriter. Although his mainstream career spanned only four years, he is widely regarded as one of the most influential electric guitarists in the history of popular music, and one of the most celebrated musicians of the 20th century. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame describes him as ""arguably the greatest instrumentalist in the history of rock music.""</p><p>Born in Seattle, Washington, Hendrix began playing guitar at the age of 15. In 1961, he enlisted in the US Army, but was discharged the following year. Soon afterward, he moved to Clarksville then Nashville, Tennessee, and began playing gigs on the chitlin' circuit, earning a place in the Isley Brothers' backing band and later with Little Richard, with whom he continued to work through mid-1965. He then played with Curtis Knight and the Squires before moving to England in late 1966 after bassist Chas Chandler of the Animals became his manager. Within months, Hendrix had earned three UK top ten hits with the Jimi Hendrix Experience: ""Hey Joe"", ""Purple Haze"", and ""The Wind Cries Mary"". He achieved fame in the US after his performance at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967, and in 1968 his third and final studio album, <i>Electric Ladyland</i>, reached number one in the US. The double LP was Hendrix's most commercially successful release and his first and only number one album. The world's highest-paid performer, he headlined the Woodstock Festival in 1969 and the Isle of Wight Festival in 1970 before his accidental death in London from barbiturate-related asphyxia on September 18, 1970.
</p><p>Hendrix was inspired by American rock and roll and electric blues. He favored overdriven amplifiers with high volume and gain, and was instrumental in popularizing the previously undesirable sounds caused by guitar amplifier feedback. He was also one of the first guitarists to make extensive use of tone-altering effects units in mainstream rock, such as fuzz distortion, Octavia, wah-wah, and Uni-Vibe. He was the first musician to use stereophonic phasing effects in recordings. Holly George-Warren of <i>Rolling Stone</i> commented: ""Hendrix pioneered the use of the instrument as an electronic sound source. Players before him had experimented with feedback and distortion, but Hendrix turned those effects and others into a controlled, fluid vocabulary every bit as personal as the blues with which he began.""</p><p>Hendrix was the recipient of several music awards during his lifetime and posthumously. In 1967, readers of <i>Melody Maker</i> voted him the Pop Musician of the Year and in 1968, <i>Billboard</i> named him the Artist of the Year and <i>Rolling Stone</i> declared him the Performer of the Year. <i>Disc and Music Echo</i> honored him with the World Top Musician of 1969 and in 1970, <i>Guitar Player</i> named him the Rock Guitarist of the Year. The Jimi Hendrix Experience was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. <i>Rolling Stone</i> ranked the band's three studio albums, <i>Are You Experienced</i>, <i>Axis: Bold as Love</i>, and <i>Electric Ladyland</i>, among the 100 greatest albums of all time, and they ranked Hendrix as the greatest guitarist and the sixth-greatest artist of all time.

</p>
<p><b>Fall Out Boy</b> is an American rock band formed in Wilmette, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, in 2001. The band consists of lead vocalist and guitarist Patrick Stump, bassist Pete Wentz, drummer Andy Hurley, and guitarist Joe Trohman. The band originated from Chicago's hardcore punk scene and was formed by Wentz and Trohman as a pop-punk side project; Stump joined shortly thereafter. The group went through a succession of drummers before Hurley joined. Their debut album, <i>Take This to Your Grave</i> (2003), became an underground success and helped the band gain a dedicated fanbase through heavy touring. <i>Take This to Your Grave</i> is cited as influential on pop-punk music in the 2000s.
</p><p>With Wentz as the band's lyricist and Stump as the primary composer, Fall Out Boy's 2005 major-label breakthrough, <i>From Under the Cork Tree</i>, produced two hit singles, ""Sugar, We're Goin Down"" and ""Dance, Dance"". It went double platinum, transforming the group into superstars and making Wentz a celebrity and tabloid fixture. Fall Out Boy received a Best New Artist nomination at the 2006 Grammy Awards. <i>Infinity on High</i> (2007) debuted at number one on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 with 260,000 first week sales. It produced two worldwide hit singles, ""This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race"" and ""Thnks fr th Mmrs"". <i>Folie à Deux</i> (2008), was a commercial disappointment and received a mixed response. Following the release of <i>Believers Never Die – Greatest Hits</i> in 2009, the band went on hiatus and the members worked on side projects.
</p><p><i>Save Rock and Roll</i> (2013) became Fall Out Boy's second number-one album, and included the top 20 single ""My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark (Light Em Up)"". The same year, the band released the EP <i>PAX AM Days</i>, consisting of 8 punk-influenced tracks that were recorded during a two-day session with producer Ryan Adams. The band's sixth studio album, <i>American Beauty/American Psycho</i> (2015) peaked at number one on the <i>Billboard</i> 200, and spawned the top-10 hit ""Centuries"" and the single ""Uma Thurman"" which reached No. 22 on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. This was followed by their first remix album <i>Make America Psycho Again</i>, which featured the remixes of all original tracks from <i>American Beauty/American Psycho</i> by a different artist on each song, including Migos and Wiz Khalifa.
</p><p>The band's seventh studio album <i>Mania</i> (2018), also peaked at No. 1, making it the band's fourth No. 1 album and sixth consecutive top 10 album. The Mania tour included a show at Wrigley Field, their first headlining stadium show. In 2018, Fall Out Boy also received their second Grammy nomination for Best Rock Album for <i>Mania</i>. On January 18, 2023, the group announced its eighth studio album, <i>So Much (for) Stardust</i>, which is set for release on March 24.

</p><p>Depeche Mode, originally formed by the lineup of Gahan, Gore, Andy Fletcher and Vince Clarke, released their debut album <i>Speak &amp; Spell</i> in 1981, bringing the band onto the British new wave scene. After founding member Clarke left following the release of the album, they recorded <i>A Broken Frame</i> as a trio. Gore took over as main songwriter and later, in 1982, Alan Wilder replaced Clarke, establishing a lineup that continued for 13 years. The band's last albums of the 1980s, <i>Black Celebration</i> and <i>Music for the Masses</i>, established them as a dominant force within the electronic music scene.

In early 1990, they released <i>Violator</i>, an international mainstream success. The following album <i>Songs of Faith and Devotion</i>, released in 1993, was also a success, though the band's internal struggles during recording and touring resulted in Wilder's departure in 1995.

AllMusic considers him to be ""among the most important dance music figures of the early 1990s, helping bring dance music to a mainstream audience both in the United States and the United Kingdom"".</p><p>After taking up guitar and piano at age nine, he played in several underground punk rock bands through the 1980s before turning to electronic dance music. In 1989, he moved to New York City and became a prolific figure as a DJ, producer and remixer. His 1991 single ""Go"" was his mainstream breakthrough, especially in Europe, where it peaked within the top ten of the charts in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Between 1992 and 1997 he scored eight top 10 hits on the <i>Billboard</i> Dance Club Songs chart including ""Move (You Make Me Feel So Good)"", ""Feeling So Real"", and ""James Bond Theme (Moby Re-Version)"".

</p>
<p><b>Bob Dylan</b> (legally <b>Robert Dylan</b>, born <b>Robert Allen Zimmerman</b>, May 24, 1941) is an American singer-songwriter. Often regarded as one of the greatest songwriters of all time, Dylan has been a major figure in popular culture during a career spanning more than 60 years. Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s, when songs such as ""Blowin' in the Wind"" (1963) and ""The Times They Are a-Changin'<span>""</span> (1964) became anthems for the civil rights and antiwar movements. His lyrics during this period incorporated a range of political, social, philosophical, and literary influences, defying pop music conventions and appealing to the burgeoning counterculture.</p><p>Following his self-titled debut album in 1962, which comprised mainly traditional folk songs, Dylan made his breakthrough as a songwriter with the release of <i>The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan</i> the following year. The album features ""Blowin' in the Wind"" and the thematically complex ""A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall"". Many of his songs adapted the tunes and phraseology of older folk songs. He went on to release the politically charged <i>The Times They Are a-Changin'</i> and the more lyrically abstract and introspective <i>Another Side of Bob Dylan</i> in 1964. In 1965 and 1966, Dylan drew controversy among folk purists when he adopted electrically amplified rock instrumentation, and in the space of 15 months recorded three of the most important and influential rock albums of the 1960s: <i>Bringing It All Back Home</i>, <i>Highway 61 Revisited</i> (both 1965) and <i>Blonde on Blonde</i> (1966). His six-minute single ""Like a Rolling Stone"" (1965) expanded commercial and creative boundaries in popular music.</p><p>In July 1966, a motorcycle accident led to Dylan's withdrawal from touring. During this period, he recorded a large body of songs with members of the Band, who had previously backed him on tour. These recordings were released as the collaborative album <i>The Basement Tapes</i> in 1975. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Dylan explored country music and rural themes in <i>John Wesley Harding</i> (1967), <i>Nashville Skyline</i> (1969), and <i>New Morning</i> (1970). In 1975, he released <i>Blood on the Tracks</i>, which many saw as a return to form. In the late 1970s, he became a born-again Christian and released a series of albums of contemporary gospel music before returning to his more familiar rock-based idiom in the early 1980s.

<p><b>Placebo</b> are a rock band, formed in London in 1994 by vocalist–guitarist Brian Molko and bassist–guitarist Stefan Olsdal. Drummer Robert Schultzberg joined in late 1994, but left in 1996 shortly after the release of the band's eponymous debut album due to conflicts with Molko, and was replaced the same year by Steve Hewitt.
</p><p>Following the release of a demo, a split single, and their eponymous debut album, Placebo gained exposure in 1997 after the single ""Nancy Boy"" became popular in the UK, a song notorious at the time for its gender-bending content. The band stood out amongst the Britpop scene they were associated with at the time for their androgynous appearance and musical content, and lyrics which openly discussed sexuality, mental health, and drug use.
</p><p>Hewitt left Placebo in 2007, due to personal and musical differences. He was replaced the following year by Steve Forrest. Placebo released two albums with Forrest, who left in 2015 to pursue his own musical career. Since 2015, Placebo are officially a duo, though augmented with additional musicians. 
</p><p>Placebo have collaborated with various artists over the years, including David Bowie, Justin Warfield, Michael Stipe and Alison Mosshart. To date, Placebo have released eight studio albums, all of which have reached the Top 20 in the United Kingdom, and have sold around 11 million records worldwide.</p>",London

<p><b>Sir Elton Hercules John</b>  (born <b>Reginald Kenneth Dwight</b>; 25 March 1947) is a British singer, pianist and composer. Collaborating with lyricist Bernie Taupin since 1967, John is one of the most successful artists of all time, having sold over 300 million records worldwide in a six decade career in music. He is acclaimed by critics and musicians, particularly for his work during the 1970s, and his lasting impact on the music industry. John's music and showmanship have had a significant impact on popular music. His songwriting partnership with Taupin is one of the most successful in history.</p><p>John was raised in the Pinner suburb of London and learned to play piano at an early age, forming the blues band Bluesology in 1962. After leaving Bluesology in 1967 to embark on a solo career, John met Taupin after they both answered an advert for songwriters. For two years, they wrote songs for other artists, and John worked as a session musician. John released his debut album <i>Empty Sky</i> in 1969, and a year later formed the Elton John Band and released his first hit single, ""Your Song"".</p><p>John's critical success was at its peak in the 1970s, when he released a streak of chart-topping albums in the US and UK, which began with <i>Honky Château</i> (1972) and culminated with <i>Rock of the Westies</i> (1975)<i>.</i> John continued his success in the 1980s and 1990s, having several hit singles and albums in both decades, and has continued to record new music since then.

In 2018, John began his ongoing farewell tour Farewell Yellow Brick Road, which is scheduled to conclude in 2023. His life and career were dramatised in the 2019 biopic <i>Rocketman.</i>
</p><p>Outside of music, John is an HIV/AIDS charity fundraiser and has been involved in the fight against AIDS since the late 1980s. He established the Elton John AIDS Foundation in 1992, which has raised over £300 million since its inception, and a year later he began hosting his annual AIDS Foundation Academy Awards Party, which has since become one of the biggest high-profile Oscar parties in the Hollywood film industry. John was the chairman and director of Watford F.C, from 1976 to 1987, and again from 1997 to 2002, and is an honorary life president of the club. From the late 1970s to the late 1980s, John developed a severe addiction problem to drugs and alcohol, but has been sober since 1990. Having been with Canadian filmmaker David Furnish since 1993, they entered into a civil partnership in 2005 and married in 2014 after same-sex marriage became legal in England and Wales.</p><p>John has sold over 300 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling artists of all time. He has more than fifty Top 40 hits in the UK Singles Chart and US <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100, including nine number ones in the UK and US, as well as seven consecutive number-one albums in the US. His tribute single ""Candle in the Wind 1997"", a rewritten version of his 1974 single in dedication to Princess Diana, sold over 33<span> </span>million copies worldwide and is the best-selling chart single of all time. In 2021, John became the first solo artist with UK Top 10 singles across six decades.</p><p>John has received numerous awards, including five Grammy Awards, five Brit Awards; including for Outstanding Contribution to Music; two Academy Awards, two Golden Globes, a Tony Award, a Laurence Olivier Award, a Disney Legend Award, and the Kennedy Center Honor.

</p>
<p><b>Scott Ramon Seguro Mescudi</b> (born January 30, 1984), also known by his stage name <b>Kid Cudi</b> (<span></span> <i title=""English pronunciation respelling""><span>KUDD</span>-ee</i>), is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, record producer, actor and fashion designer. Born and raised in Cleveland, Ohio, Cudi would move to New York City in pursuit of a musical career, where he first gained major recognition following the release of his debut single ""Day 'n' Nite"", which he initially self-published on his MySpace page. The song went on to become a worldwide hit and served as the catalyst for Cudi to team with American record producers Plain Pat and Emile Haynie, to record his first official full-length project, a mixtape titled <i>A Kid Named Cudi</i> (2008). The mixtape helped Cudi rise to prominence and establish a fan base, and it caught the attention of high-profile musician Kanye West, who subsequently signed Cudi to his GOOD Music label imprint by late 2008.
</p><p>Cudi's commercial debut single was later remastered and featured on his seminal debut album, <i>Man on the Moon: The End of Day</i> (2009), which was certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album also included the singles ""Make Her Say"" (featuring Kanye West and Common) and ""Pursuit of Happiness"" (featuring MGMT and Ratatat), the latter of which achieved diamond status (10x platinum) by the RIAA. In 2010, Cudi released his second album, <i>Man on the Moon II: The Legend of Mr. Rager</i>, which also attained platinum status and features the singles ""Erase Me"" (featuring Kanye West) and ""Mr. Rager"". Later that year he formed WZRD, a rock band, with his long-time collaborator Dot da Genius. Their eponymous debut album (2012) debuted at number one on the <i>Billboard</i> Top Rock Albums chart.</p><p>Cudi would go on to release the self-produced solo album <i>Indicud</i> (2013), which was certified gold by the RIAA and spawned the platinum-selling single ""Just What I Am"" (featuring King Chip). He would continue to produce the bulk of his own records, including the avant-garde music albums <i>Satellite Flight: The Journey to Mother Moon</i> (2014) and <i>Speedin' Bullet 2 Heaven</i> (2015), the latter of which was led by the grunge-inspired single ""Confused!"". In 2016, the release of his sixth solo album <i>Passion, Pain &amp; Demon Slayin'</i>, was supported by the lead single ""Surfin'"" (featuring Pharrell Williams). Cudi's joint album with Kanye West, under the eponymous name <i>Kids See Ghosts</i> (2018), was met with widespread critical acclaim. In April 2020, Cudi earned his first number-one song on the US <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 chart with ""The Scotts"", alongside fellow American rapper Travis Scott. His seventh album, <i>Man on the Moon III: The Chosen</i> (2020), was highly acclaimed and a commercial success, having been certified gold by the RIAA. Cudi issued his eighth album <i>Entergalactic</i> (2022), coinciding with the release of a adult animated special of the same name inspired by the album, which was critically praised.
</p><p>After signing to GOOD Music, Cudi has since gone on to launch his own vanity labels, the now-dissolved Dream On and current label imprint Wicked Awesome Records. Cudi also ventured into acting in 2010, when he was cast in the HBO series <i>How to Make It in America</i>. He has since appeared in several feature films, including <i>Goodbye World</i> (2013), <i>Need for Speed</i> (2014), <i>Entourage</i> (2015), <i>Bill &amp; Ted Face the Music</i> (2020), <i>Don't Look Up</i> (2021), and <i>X</i> (2022). In addition, he has made appearances on television shows such as <i>One Tree Hill</i>, <i>The Cleveland Show</i>, <i>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</i>, and <i>Westworld</i>. In 2015, he was the bandleader on the IFC series <i>Comedy Bang! Bang!</i> and in 2020 was added as a cast member for the HBO mini-series <i>We Are Who We Are</i>. In 2020, he launched Mad Solar, a production company for film and television, which produced a documentary titled <i>A Man Named Scott</i> (2021), storying Cudi's music career. Cudi is also founder, creator, and director of the clothing line ""MOTR"", which he launched in 2022.
</p><p>Kid Cudi has been widely recognized as an influence on several contemporary hip hop and alternative acts. His lyrics are often autobiographical and describe his childhood hardships of depression, loneliness and alienation, his struggle with alcohol and drugs into adulthood, and themes of spirituality, heartbreak, dissipation and celebration. The majority of his impact stems from his ability to display vulnerability and address bouts with mental health. He is also noted for his experimental nature, combining elements of psychedelia, R&amp;B, electronica, synthpop, punk and indie rock, in his music. Cudi has sold over 22 million certified records in the United States and has won two Grammy Awards from five nominations. He has worked with numerous prominent artists spanning several different genres in the music industry, namely Jay-Z, Eminem, Kendrick Lamar, David Guetta, Steve Aoki, MGMT, Mary J. Blige, Shakira, Ariana Grande and Michael Bolton, among others.</p>",

Her first major success came in early 2009 after she was featured on American rapper Flo Rida's number-one single ""Right Round"".
</p><p>Kesha's music and image propelled her to immediate success. She has earned two number-one albums on the US <i>Billboard</i> 200 with <i>Animal</i> (2010) and <i>Rainbow</i> (2017), and the top-ten records <i>Warrior</i> (2012) and <i>High Road</i> (2020).

Her 2009 single ""Tik Tok"" was the best-selling digital single in history, selling over 14 million units internationally, until surpassed in 2011.</p><p>Kesha's career was halted between <i>Warrior</i> and <i>Rainbow</i> due to a legal dispute with her former producer Dr. Luke, which has been ongoing since 2014. A series of lawsuits, known collectively as <i>Kesha v. Dr. Luke</i>, were exchanged between the two parties in which Kesha accused him of physical, sexual, and emotional abuse and employment discrimination against her, while Dr. Luke claims breach of contract and defamation by Kesha.
</p><p>As of 2013, Kesha has reportedly sold over 33 million combined tracks and ringtones in the U.S alone and over 55 million worldwide to date. She was also listed as the 26th top artist on <i>Billboard</i><span>'</span>s 2010s decade-end charts.

The band is signed to Fueled by Ramen, a subsidiary of Atlantic Records, both owned by Warner Music Group. Williams was separately signed to Atlantic as she was scouted when she was a teenager, and they were the only label to let her stay in the band instead of going solo, but Atlantic said the rest of the band had to sign to Fueled by Ramen. She is also the only member to appear on all six of Paramore's studio albums.</p><p>The group released its debut album, <i>All We Know Is Falling</i>, in 2005, with the album reaching number four on the UK Rock Chart in 2009 and number thirty on <i>Billboard</i><span>'</span>s Heatseekers Chart in 2006.
</p><p>The band's second album, <i>Riot!</i>, was released in 2007.

Paramore then received a Best New Artist nomination at the 2008 Grammy Awards. Their 2009 follow-up, <i>Brand New Eyes</i>, is the band's second-highest-charting album to date, landing at number two on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 with 175,000 first-week sales. It produced the top-forty single ""The Only Exception"" and went platinum in Ireland and the UK, as well as gold in the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.</p><p>Following the departure of Josh and Zac Farro in 2010, the band released their self-titled fourth album in 2013. It gave the band their first number one on the US <i>Billboard</i> 200 and was also the number one album in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Argentina and Mexico. It included the singles ""Still Into You"" and ""Ain't It Fun"", with the latter winning the Grammy Award for Best Rock Song for Williams and York as songwriters, making it Paramore's first Grammy Award win. The band's lineup changed once again after this album cycle, with bassist Jeremy Davis leaving the band near the end of 2015 and former drummer Zac Farro rejoining the band in 2017. Their fifth studio album, <i>After Laughter</i>, was released later that year to critical acclaim. Their sixth studio album, <i>This Is Why</i>, was released in February 2023.

</p>
<p><b>Mariah Carey</b> (<span></span>; born March 27, 1969) is an American singer, songwriter, record producer, and actress. Referred to as the ""Songbird Supreme"" by <i>Guinness World Records</i>, she is noted for her five-octave vocal range, melismatic singing style, improvisation skills, her signature use of the whistle register, and songwriting. For the enduring popularity of her holiday music, particularly the 1994 song ""All I Want for Christmas Is You"", she has also been dubbed the ""Queen of Christmas"". Carey rose to fame in 1990 with her debut album <i>Mariah Carey</i>. She was the first artist to have their first five singles reach number one on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100, from ""Vision of Love"" to ""Emotions"". An inductee into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, she is credited for inspiring several generations of pop and R&amp;B artists, and for merging hip hop with pop music through her crossover collaborations.</p><p>Carey's self-titled debut album was released under the guidance of Columbia Records executive Tommy Mottola, who married her three years later. She gained further worldwide success with the albums <i>Music Box</i> (1993)  and <i>Daydream</i> (1995). Their singles include ""Hero"", ""Without You"", ""Fantasy"", ""Always Be My Baby"", and ""One Sweet Day"", which topped the US <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 decade-end chart (1990s) and was the longest running number one song of the decade. After separating from Mottola, Carey adopted a new urban image and incorporated more elements of hip hop with the album <i>Butterfly</i> (1997). She left Columbia in 2001 after eleven consecutive years of US number-one singles and signed a $100 million record deal with Virgin Records.
</p><p>Following Carey's highly publicized physical and emotional breakdown and the failure of the film <i>Glitter</i> (2001) and its soundtrack, Virgin bought out her contract and she signed with Island Records the following year. After a comparatively unsuccessful period, Carey returned to the top of the charts with <i>The Emancipation of Mimi</i> (2005), which became the best-selling album in the US and the world's second best-selling album of 2005. Its second single, ""We Belong Together"", topped the US <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 decade-end chart (2000s). She won the Breakthrough Actress Performance award at the Palm Springs International Film Festival for her role in the 2009 film <i>Precious</i>. Carey's subsequent ventures included being an <i>American Idol</i> judge, starring in the docu-series <i>Mariah's World</i>, appearing in the films <i>The Butler</i> (2013), <i>A Christmas Melody</i> (2015), and <i>The Lego Batman Movie</i> (2017), performing at two Las Vegas concert residencies, and publishing her memoir <i>The Meaning of Mariah Carey</i> in 2020.
</p><p>Carey is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with over 220 million records sold worldwide. She was ranked as the fifth greatest singer of all time by <i>Rolling Stone</i> in 2023 and placed second in VH1's list of the 100 Greatest Women in Music. She holds the record for the most <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 number-one singles by a solo artist (19), a female songwriter (18), and a female producer (15). Carey is the highest-certified female artist in the United States and 10th overall, with 74 million certified album units. In 2008, she was named one of Time's annual 100 most influential artists and entertainers in the world. <i>Billboard</i> named her the ""top-charting female solo artist"", based on both album and song chart success in 2019. Carey has won 5 Grammy Awards, 19 World Music Awards, 10 American Music Awards, 15 <i>Billboard</i> Music Awards and eight Guinness World Records.

<p><b>John Clayton Mayer</b> (<span></span> <i title=""English pronunciation respelling""><span>MAY</span>-ər</i>; born October 16, 1977) is an American singer, songwriter, and guitarist. Born and raised in Fairfield County, Connecticut, Mayer attended Berklee College of Music in Boston, but left   and moved to Atlanta in 1997 with Clay Cook. Together, they formed a short-lived two-man band called Lo-Fi Masters. After their split, Mayer continued to play local clubs, refining his skills and gaining a following. After his appearance at the 2001 South by Southwest festival, he was signed to Aware Records, and eventually to Columbia Records, which released his first extended play <i>Inside Wants Out</i>. His following two studio albums—<i>Room for Squares</i> (2001) and <i>Heavier Things</i> (2003)—performed well commercially, achieving multi-platinum status. In 2003, he won the Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for his single ""Your Body Is a Wonderland"".
</p><p>By 2005, Mayer had moved away from the acoustic music that characterized his early records, and begun performing the blues and rock music that had originally influenced him as a musician. He collaborated with blues artists such as B.B. King, Buddy Guy, and Eric Clapton. Forming the John Mayer Trio, he released a live album, <i>Try!</i>, in 2005 and his third studio album <i>Continuum</i> in 2006. Both albums received positive reviews, and <i>Continuum</i> earned Mayer a 2007 Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album. He also won Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for ""Waiting on the World to Change"". That album was followed by <i>Battle Studies</i> in 2009, a return to pop, with a Battle Studies World Tour.
</p><p>After having several controversial incidents with the media, Mayer withdrew from public life in 2010 and began work on his fifth studio album, <i>Born and Raised</i>, which drew inspiration from the 1970s pop music of Laurel Canyon. However, the discovery of a granuloma on his vocal cords delayed the release of the album until May 2012, and forced him to cancel the planned tour. The album received a generally favorable reception, though was less commercially successful than his previous work. Mayer began performing as a singer again in January 2013, and that year released his sixth studio album, <i>Paradise Valley</i>, which incorporates country music influences. By 2014, he had sold a total of over 20 million albums worldwide. His seventh album, <i>The Search for Everything</i>, a loose concept album based around the theme of a romantic break-up, was released in 2017. Mayer released his latest album, <i>Sob Rock</i>, inspired by 1980s soft rock music, in July 2021.
</p><p>In 2015, three former members of the Grateful Dead joined with Mayer and two other musicians to form the band Dead &amp; Company. It is the latest of several reunions of the band's surviving members since Jerry Garcia's death in 1995. The band remains active and its tours have been well received.</p><p>Mayer's secondary career pursuits extend to television hosting, comedy, and writing; he has authored columns for magazines such as <i>Esquire</i>. He supports various causes and has performed at charity benefits. He is a watch aficionado (with a collection he values in the ""tens of millions"" of dollars), contributing to the watch site <i>Hodinkee</i>, and has been on the jury at the <i>Grand Prix d'Horlogerie de Genève</i>.</p>

</p>
<p><b>Black Sabbath</b> were an English rock band formed in Birmingham in 1968 by guitarist Tony Iommi, drummer Bill Ward, bassist Geezer Butler and vocalist Ozzy Osbourne. They are often cited as pioneers of heavy metal music. The band helped define the genre with releases such as <i>Black Sabbath</i> (1970), <i>Paranoid</i> (1970) and <i>Master of Reality</i> (1971). The band had multiple line-up changes following Osbourne's departure in 1979 and Iommi is the only constant member throughout their history.
</p><p>After previous iterations of the group – the Polka Tulk Blues Band and Earth – the band settled on the name Black Sabbath in 1969. They distinguished themselves through occult themes with horror-inspired lyrics and down-tuned guitars. Signing to Philips Records in November 1969, they released their first single, ""Evil Woman"", in January 1970, and their debut album, <i>Black Sabbath</i>, was released the following month. Though it received a negative critical response, the album was a commercial success, leading to a follow-up record, <i>Paranoid</i>, later that year. The band's popularity grew, and by 1973's <i>Sabbath Bloody Sabbath</i>, critics were starting to respond favourably.
</p><p>Osbourne's excessive substance abuse led to his firing in 1979. He was replaced by former Rainbow vocalist Ronnie James Dio. Following two albums with Dio, <i>Heaven and Hell</i> and <i>Mob Rules</i>, the second of which saw drummer Vinny Appice replace Ward, Black Sabbath endured many personnel changes from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s that included vocalists Ian Gillan, Glenn Hughes, Ray Gillen and Tony Martin, as well as several drummers and bassists, with Butler's departure in 1984 leaving Iommi as the only remaining original member. Martin, who replaced Gillen in 1987, was the second-longest serving vocalist after Osbourne and recorded three albums with Black Sabbath before his dismissal in 1991. That same year, Iommi rejoined with Butler, Dio and Appice to record <i>Dehumanizer</i> (1992). After two more studio albums with Martin, who returned to replace Dio in 1993, the band's original line-up reunited in 1997 and released a live album, <i>Reunion,</i> the following year; they continued to tour occasionally until 2005. Other than various back catalogue reissues and compilation albums, as well as the <i>Mob Rules</i>-era line-up reuniting as Heaven &amp; Hell, there was no further activity under the Black Sabbath name until 2011 with the release of their final studio album and 19th overall, <i>13</i>, in 2013, which features all of the original members except Ward. During their farewell tour, the band played their final concert in their home city of Birmingham on 4 February 2017. Occasional partial reunions have happened since, most recently when Osbourne and Iommi performed together at the closing ceremony of the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham.</p><p>Black Sabbath have sold over 70 million records worldwide as of 2013, making them one of the most commercially successful heavy metal bands. Black Sabbath, together with Deep Purple and Led Zeppelin, have been referred to as the ""unholy trinity of British hard rock and heavy metal in the early to mid-seventies"". They were ranked by MTV as the ""Greatest Metal Band of All Time"" and placed second on VH1's ""100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock"" list. <i>Rolling Stone</i> magazine ranked them number 85 on their ""100 Greatest Artists of All Time"". Black Sabbath were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006. They have also won two Grammy Awards for Best Metal Performance, and in 2019 the band were presented a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.</p>",Birmingham

</p>
<p><b>The Beach Boys</b> are an American rock band that formed in Hawthorne, California, in 1961. The group's original lineup consisted of brothers Brian, Dennis, and Carl Wilson, their cousin Mike Love, and friend Al Jardine. Distinguished by their vocal harmonies,  adolescent-themed lyrics, and  musical ingenuity, they are one of the most influential acts of the rock era. They drew on the music of older pop vocal groups, 1950s rock and roll, and black R&amp;B to create their unique sound. Under Brian's direction, they often incorporated classical or jazz elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways.
</p><p>The Beach Boys began as a garage band, managed by the Wilsons' father, Murry, with Brian serving as composer, arranger, producer, and <i>de facto</i> leader. In 1963, they enjoyed their first national hit with ""Surfin' U.S.A."", beginning a string of top-ten singles that reflected a southern California youth culture of surfing, cars, and romance, dubbed the ""California sound"". They were one of the few American rock bands to sustain their commercial standing during the British Invasion. Starting with 1965's <i>The Beach Boys Today!</i>, they abandoned beachgoing themes for more personal lyrics and ambitious orchestrations. In 1966, the <i>Pet Sounds</i> album and ""Good Vibrations"" single raised the group's prestige as rock innovators. After scrapping the <i>Smile</i> album in 1967, Brian gradually ceded control of the group to his bandmates.
</p><p>In the late 1960s, the group's commercial momentum faltered in the US, and despite efforts to maintain an experimental sound, they were widely dismissed by the early rock music press. After Carl took over as  musical leader, the band made records that would later enjoy a cult following among fans. In the mid-1970s, as their concerts drew larger audiences, the band transitioned into an oldies act. Dennis drowned in 1983 and Brian soon became estranged from the group. Following Carl's death from lung cancer in 1998, the band granted Love legal rights to tour under the group's name. In the early 2010s, the original members briefly reunited for the band's 50th anniversary. As of 2022, Brian and Jardine do not perform with Love's edition of the Beach Boys, but remain official members of the band.
</p><p>
The Beach Boys are one of the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful bands of all time, selling over 100 million records worldwide. They helped legitimize popular music as a recognized art form and influenced the development of music genres and movements such as psychedelia, power pop, progressive rock, punk, alternative, and lo-fi. Between the 1960s and 2020s, the group had 37 songs reach the US Top 40 (the most by an American band), with four topping the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. In 2004, they were ranked number 12 on <i>Rolling Stone</i><span>'</span>s list of the greatest artists of all time. The founding members were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988. </p>",Hawthorne

</p>
<p><b>Kelly Brianne</b>, known professionally as <b>Kelly Clarkson</b>, (born April 24, 1982) is an American singer, songwriter, author, and television personality. She rose to fame after winning the first season of <i>American Idol</i> in 2002, which earned her a record deal with RCA. Her debut single, ""A Moment Like This"", topped the US <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100, and became the country's best selling single of 2002. It was included on her debut studio album, <i>Thankful</i> (2003), which debuted atop the <i>Billboard</i> 200. Trying to reinvent her image, Clarkson parted ways with <i>Idol</i> management and shifted to pop rock for her second studio album, <i>Breakaway</i> (2004). Supported by four US top-ten singles – the title track, ""Since U Been Gone"", ""Behind These Hazel Eyes"", and ""Because of You"" – <i>Breakaway</i> sold over 12 million copies worldwide and won two Grammy Awards.
</p><p>Clarkson took further creative control for her third studio album, <i>My December</i> (2007), co-writing all of its tracks and becoming its executive producer. However, her label was dissatisfied with the album's darker rock music and promoted it reluctantly. Clarkson's fourth and fifth studio albums, <i>All I Ever Wanted</i> (2009) and <i>Stronger</i> (2011), returned to a lighter tone and pop rock sound, with the former becoming her second US number-one album and the latter making her the first artist to win the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album twice. Both albums spawned a Hot 100 number-one single: ""My Life Would Suck Without You"", which holds the record for the biggest jump to number one in the chart's history, and ""Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)"", which became her best-selling single worldwide. Clarkson then had the best-selling Christmas album of the year with <i>Wrapped in Red</i> (2013). Its single, ""Underneath the Tree"", was named the ASCAP's most popular Christmas song released in the 21st century. Her seventh studio album, <i>Piece by Piece</i> (2015), debuted at number-one in the US, while its title track reached the top ten. After leaving RCA and signing with Atlantic in 2016, Clarkson released her soul-influenced eighth album, <i>Meaning of Life</i> (2017), and her second Christmas album, <i>When Christmas Comes Around...</i> (2021).
</p><p>Clarkson has sold over 25 million albums and 45 million singles worldwide. She has 11 top-ten singles in the US, and nine top-ten singles in the UK, Canada, and Australia. She became the first artist in history to top each of <i>Billboard</i>'s pop, adult contemporary, adult pop, country, and dance charts. Clarkson has also served as a coach on <i>The Voice</i> from its fourteenth season to the twenty-first season, and again for the twenty-third season. Since 2019, she has hosted her own talk show, <i>The Kelly Clarkson Show</i>. Among her numerous accolades, Clarkson has received three MTV Video Music Awards, four American Music Awards, two Academy of Country Music Awards, five Daytime Emmy Awards, and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. <i>Billboard</i> has hailed Clarkson as ""one of pop music's greatest singers"", and honored her with the Powerhouse Award, while VH1 ranked her nineteenth on their list of the 100 Greatest Women in Music.

</p>
<p><b>Clifford Joseph Harris Jr.</b> (born September 25, 1980), better known by the stage names <b>T.I.</b> and <b>Tip</b> (often stylized as <b>TIP</b> or <b>T.I.P.</b>), is an American rapper. Born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia, Harris is one of the highest selling hip-hop artists of all time and is also known as one of the pioneers of the hip hop subgenre trap music, along with fellow Atlanta-based rappers Jeezy and Gucci Mane. Harris signed his first major-label record deal in 1999 with Arista Records subsidiary LaFace. In 2001, he released <i>I'm Serious</i>, his solo debut and only album with the label, as well as formed the southern hip hop group P$C. Upon being dropped from Arista, Harris signed to Atlantic and soon co-founded his own label imprint, Grand Hustle Records, which he launched in 2002.</p><p>Harris, a three time Grammy Award winner, has released 11 studio albums, with seven of them reaching the top five of the US <i>Billboard</i> 200 chart. During his career, Harris has also released several highly successful singles, including Billboard Hot 100 number-one hits ""Whatever You Like"" and ""Live Your Life"" (featuring Rihanna); the latter replaced the former atop the chart and made Harris one of the few artists who replaced themselves at number one and simultaneously occupied the top two positions. Harris began to gain major recognition in 2003 following his first high-profile feature on fellow Atlanta-based rapper Bone Crusher's single ""Never Scared"". Harris earned more prominence with the release of <i>Trap Muzik</i> (2003), which included the Top 40 songs ""Rubber Band Man"" and ""Let's Get Away"" (featuring Jazze Pha). The following year, Harris appeared on Destiny's Child's international hit ""Soldier"" (alongside Lil Wayne), and capitalized on it with the release of his <i>Urban Legend</i> (2004) album. His subsequent albums, <i>King</i> and <i>T.I. vs. T.I.P.</i>, generated high record sales and were supported by popular singles, such as ""What You Know"" and ""Big Shit Poppin' (Do It)"", respectively.
</p><p>Harris' sixth album, <i>Paper Trail</i> (2008), became his most successful project, with the album being certified gold for first-week sales of over 500,000 copies in the United States, additionally making it his third consecutive number one album. In 2013, Harris was featured on Robin Thicke's single ""Blurred Lines"" (alongside Pharrell Williams), which peaked at number one on several major music charts. In November 2013, Harris announced that he had signed with Columbia Records after his 10-year contract with Atlantic came to an end. He released his Columbia debut <i>Paperwork,</i> in October 2014. In February 2016, Harris signed a distribution deal with Roc Nation and another deal with Epic Records in September 2018. The former served as a means to release his political <i>Us or Else</i> EP series, while the latter released his long-delayed tenth album <i>Dime Trap</i> in October of that year.
</p><p>Harris has served two terms in county jail, twice for probation violations and a federal prison bid for a U.S. federal weapons charge. While serving 11 months in prison, he released his seventh studio album <i>No Mercy</i> (2010). Harris branched out into entrepreneurship with his label, Grand Hustle Records, which he co-founded in 2003 with longtime business partner Jason Geter. Prominent industry acts have been signed to T.I. through the label, including Travis Scott, B.o.B, and Iggy Azalea. Harris has also had a successful acting career, starring in the films <i>ATL</i>, <i>Takers</i>, <i>Get Hard</i>, <i>Identity Thief</i>, and in the Marvel Cinematic Universe films <i>Ant-Man</i> and its sequel. He is also a published author of two novels, <i>Power &amp; Beauty</i> (2011) and <i>Trouble &amp; Triumph</i> (2012), both of which were released to moderate success. Harris has also starred in the American reality television series <i>T.I.'s Road to Redemption</i>, <i>T.I. &amp; Tiny: The Family Hustle</i>, and <i>The Grand Hustle</i>. In 2009, <i>Billboard</i> ranked him as the 27th best artist of the 2000s decade.</p>

</p>
<p><b>Margaret D. H. Keane</b> (born <b>Peggy Doris Hawkins</b>, September 15, 1927 – June 26, 2022) was an American artist known for her paintings of subjects with big eyes. She mainly painted women, children, or animals in oil or mixed media. The work achieved commercial success through inexpensive reproductions on prints, plates, and cups. It has been critically acclaimed but also criticized as formulaic and cliché. The artwork was originally attributed to Keane's ex-husband, Walter Keane. After their divorce in the 1960s, Margaret soon claimed credit, which was established after a court ""paint-off"" in Hawaii.</p><p>A resurgence of interest in Margaret Keane's work followed the release of Tim Burton's 2014 biopic <i>Big Eyes</i>. She maintained a gallery in San Francisco which boasts ""the largest collection of Margaret Keane's art in the entire world."" In light of the great gulf between her work's popularity and its critical lampooning, she was sometimes referred to as the ""Wayne Newton of the art world.""</p>",

<p><b>Eric Patrick Clapton</b>  (born <span>30 March</span> 1945) is an English rock and blues guitarist, singer, and songwriter. He is regarded as one of the most successful and influential guitarists in rock music. Clapton ranked second in <i>Rolling Stone</i><span>'</span>s list of the ""100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time"" and fourth in Gibson<span>'</span>s ""Top 50 Guitarists of All Time"". He was also named number five in <i>Time</i> magazine's list of ""The 10 Best Electric Guitar Players"" in 2009.</p><p>After playing in a number of different local bands, Clapton joined the Yardbirds in 1963, replacing founding guitarist Top Topham. Dissatisfied with the change of the Yardbirds sound from blues rock to a more radio-friendly pop rock sound, Clapton left in 1965 to play with John Mayall &amp; the Bluesbreakers. On leaving Mayall in 1966, after one album, he formed the power trio Cream with drummer Ginger Baker and bassist Jack Bruce, in which Clapton played sustained blues improvisations and ""arty, blues-based psychedelic pop"". After Cream broke up in November 1968, he formed the blues rock band Blind Faith with Baker, Steve Winwood, and Ric Grech, recording one album and performing on one tour before they broke up. Clapton embarked on a solo career in 1970.
</p><p>Alongside his solo career, he also performed with Delaney &amp; Bonnie and Derek and the Dominos, with whom he recorded ""Layla"", one of his signature songs. He continued to record a number of successful solo albums and songs over the next several decades, including a 1974 cover of Bob Marley's ""I Shot the Sheriff"" (which helped reggae reach a mass market), the country-infused <i>Slowhand</i> album (1977) and the pop rock of 1986's <i>August</i>.  Following the death of his son Conor in 1991, Clapton's grief was expressed in the song ""Tears in Heaven"", which appeared on his <i>Unplugged</i> album, and in 1996 he had another top-40 hit with the R&amp;B crossover ""Change the World"". In 1998, he released the Grammy award-winning ""My Father's Eyes"". Since 1999, he has recorded a number of traditional blues and blues rock albums and hosted the periodic Crossroads Guitar Festival. His most recent studio album is <i>Happy Xmas</i> (2018).
</p><p>Clapton has received 18 Grammy Awards as well as the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. In 2004, he was awarded a CBE for services to music. He has received four Ivor Novello Awards from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors, including the Lifetime Achievement Award. He is the only three-time inductee to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame: once as a solo artist and separately as a member of the Yardbirds and of Cream. In his solo career, Clapton has sold more than 280 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling musicians of all time. In 1998, Clapton, a recovering alcoholic and drug addict, founded the Crossroads Centre on Antigua, a medical facility for recovering substance abusers.</p>",

</p>
<p><b>Elvis Aaron Presley</b> (January 8, 1935 – August 16, 1977), often referred to mononymously by his first name, was an American singer, actor and Sergeant in the United States Army. Dubbed the ""King of Rock and Roll"", he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, led him to both great success and initial controversy.
</p><p>Presley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, and relocated to Memphis, Tennessee, with his family when he was 13 years old. His music career began there in 1954, recording at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring the sound of African-American music to a wider audience. Presley, on rhythm acoustic guitar, and accompanied by lead guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, was a pioneer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. In 1955, drummer D. J. Fontana joined to complete the lineup of Presley's classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who would manage him for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA Victor single, ""Heartbreak Hotel"", was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States. Within a year, RCA would sell ten million Presley singles. With a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records, Presley became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll; though his performative style and promotion of the then-marginalized sound of African Americans led to him being widely considered a threat to the moral well-being of the White American youth.</p><p>In November 1956, Presley made his film debut in <i>Love Me Tender</i>. Drafted into military service in 1958, Presley relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. He held few concerts, however, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. Some of his most famous films included <i>Jailhouse Rock</i> (1957), <i>Blue Hawaii</i> (1961), and <i>Viva Las Vegas</i> (1964). In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed television comeback special <i>Elvis</i>, which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973, Presley gave the first concert by a solo artist to be broadcast around the world, <i>Aloha from Hawaii</i>. Years of prescription drug abuse and unhealthy eating habits severely compromised his health, and he died suddenly in 1977 at his Graceland estate at the age of 42.
</p><p>Having sold over 500 million records worldwide, Presley is recognized as the best-selling solo music artist of all time by <i>Guinness World Records.</i> He was commercially successful in many genres, including pop, country, rhythm &amp; blues, adult contemporary, and gospel. Presley won three Grammy Awards, received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at age 36, and has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame. He holds several records, including the most RIAA-certified gold and platinum albums, the most albums charted on the <i>Billboard</i> 200, the most number-one albums by a solo artist on the UK Albums Chart, and the most number-one singles by any act on the UK Singles Chart. In 2018, Presley was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

<p><b>Evanescence</b> is an American rock band founded in Little Rock, Arkansas in 1995 by singer and musician Amy Lee and guitarist Ben Moody. After recording independent EPs as a duo in the late 90's, and a demo CD, Evanescence released their debut studio album, <i>Fallen</i>, on Wind-up Records in 2003. Propelled by the success of hit singles like ""Bring Me to Life"" and ""My Immortal"", <i>Fallen</i> sold more than four million copies in the US by January 2004, garnering the band two Grammy Awards out of six nominations. The band released their first live album and concert DVD, <i>Anywhere but Home</i>, in 2004, which sold over one million copies worldwide.
</p><p>Evanescence released their second studio album, <i>The Open Door</i>, in 2006, co-composed by Lee and guitarist Terry Balsamo. It sold more than six million copies worldwide, and received a Grammy nomination. They reconvened in June 2009 to work on music for their next album, with touring guitarist Troy McLawhorn, bassist Tim McCord and drummer Will Hunt becoming full-time members. The band's third studio album, <i>Evanescence</i>, was released in 2011. It debuted at the top of the <i>Billboard</i> 200 as well as the <i>Billboard</i> Rock Albums, Digital Albums, Alternative Albums, and Hard Rock Albums charts. Following the end of the album's tour cycle, the band entered a hiatus.
</p><p>In 2014, Lee and Evanescence left their record label and became independent artists. The band emerged from hiatus in 2015 and resumed touring, while new music was not yet created as Lee was also focusing on a solo project. In late 2016, Lee stated that Evanescence was working on a fourth album, <i>Synthesis</i> (2017), composed of orchestral and electronica arrangements of the band's previous material with two new songs. The album's release was followed by the Synthesis Live concert tour, during which the band performed with a live orchestra for the first time. In 2021, Evanescence released their fifth studio album, <i>The Bitter Truth</i>.
</p><p>Generally classified as a gothic alternative metal and hard rock band, Evanescence have a diverse sound containing various musical styles including classical music, alternative music, heavy metal, symphonic rock, industrial music, and electronica, driven by Lee's contrasting musical pursuits and introspective songwriting. Evanescence's lineup changed several times over the years, with Lee as the sole constant member since its inception. The band comprises Lee, guitarist Tim McCord since 2006, guitarist Troy McLawhorn and drummer Will Hunt since 2007, and bassist Emma Anzai on tour as of 2022.

The band initially consisted of lead vocalist, lead guitarist, and primary songwriter John Fogerty; his brother, rhythm guitarist Tom Fogerty; bassist Stu Cook; and drummer Doug Clifford. These members had played together since 1959, first as the Blue Velvets and later as the Golliwogs, before settling on Creedence Clearwater Revival in 1967.</p><p>CCR's musical style encompassed roots rock, swamp rock, blues rock, Southern rock, and country rock, among others. Belying their origins in the East Bay subregion of the San Francisco Bay Area, the band often played in a Southern rock style, with lyrics about bayous, catfish, the Mississippi River and other elements of Southern United States iconography. The band's songs rarely dealt with romantic love, concentrating instead on political and socially conscious lyrics about topics such as the Vietnam War. The band's most prolific and successful period between 1969 and 1971 produced fourteen consecutive top 10 singles (many of which were double A-sides) and five consecutive top 10 albums in the United States – two of which, <i>Green River</i> (1969) and <i>Cosmo's Factory</i> (1970), reached number one. The band performed at the 1969 Woodstock festival in Upstate New York, and was the first major act signed to appear there.</p><p>CCR disbanded acrimoniously in late 1972 after four years of chart-topping success. Tom Fogerty had left the previous year, and John was at odds with the remaining members over matters of business and artistic control, all of which resulted in lawsuits among the former bandmates. Fogerty's disagreements with Fantasy Records owner Saul Zaentz led to more court cases and John Fogerty refused to perform with the two other surviving members at Creedence's 1993 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Though the band has never officially reunited, John Fogerty continues to perform CCR songs as part of his solo act, while Cook and Clifford have performed as Creedence Clearwater <i>Revisited</i> since the 1990s.
</p><p>CCR's music remains a staple of U.S. classic rock radio airplay; 28 million CCR records have been sold in the U.S. alone. The compilation album <i>Chronicle: The 20 Greatest Hits</i>, originally released in 1976, is still on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 album chart and reached the 500-weeks mark in December 2020. It has been awarded 10× platinum.</p>",El Cerrito

</p>
<p><b>Francis Albert Sinatra</b> (<span></span>; December 12, 1915 – May 14, 1998) was an American singer, actor and producer. Nicknamed the ""Chairman of the Board"" and later called ""Ol' Blue Eyes"", Sinatra was one of the most popular entertainers of the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s. He is among the world's best-selling music artists with an estimated 150 million record sales.</p><p>Born to Italian immigrants in Hoboken, New Jersey, Sinatra was greatly influenced by the intimate, easy-listening vocal style of Bing Crosby and began his musical career in the swing era with bandleaders Harry James and Tommy Dorsey. He found success as a solo artist after signing with Columbia Records in 1943, becoming the idol of the ""bobby soxers"". Sinatra released his debut album, <i>The Voice of Frank Sinatra</i>, in 1946. When his film career stalled in the early 1950s, Sinatra turned to Las Vegas, where he became one of its best-known residency performers and part of the famous Rat Pack. His acting career was revived by the 1953 film <i>From Here to Eternity</i>, which earned Sinatra an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor. Sinatra then signed with Capitol Records and released several critically lauded albums, some of which were later considered as among the first ""concept albums"", including <i>In the Wee Small Hours</i> (1955), <i>Songs for Swingin' Lovers!</i> (1956), <i>Come Fly with Me</i> (1958), <i>Only the Lonely</i> (1958), <i>No One Cares</i> (1959), and <i>Nice 'n' Easy</i> (1960).
</p><p>Sinatra left Capitol in 1960 to start his own record label, Reprise Records and released a string of successful albums. In 1965, he recorded the retrospective album <i>September of My Years</i> and starred in the Emmy-winning television special <i>Frank Sinatra: A Man and His Music</i>. After releasing <i>Sinatra at the Sands</i>, recorded at the Sands Hotel and Casino in Vegas with frequent collaborator Count Basie in early 1966, the following year he recorded one of his most famous collaborations with Tom Jobim, the album <i>Francis Albert Sinatra &amp; Antonio Carlos Jobim</i>. It was followed by 1968's <i>Francis A. &amp; Edward K.</i> with Duke Ellington. Sinatra retired for the first time in 1971, but came out of retirement two years later. He recorded several albums and resumed performing at Caesars Palace, and released ""New York, New York"" in 1980. Using his Las Vegas shows as a home base, he toured within the United States and internationally until shortly before his death in 1998.
</p><p>Sinatra forged a highly successful career as a film actor. After winning an Academy Award for best supporting actor in <i>From Here to Eternity</i>, he starred in <i>The Man with the Golden Arm</i> (1955) and <i>The Manchurian Candidate</i> (1962). Sinatra also appeared in musicals such as <i>On the Town</i> (1949), <i>Guys and Dolls</i> (1955), <i>High Society</i> (1956), and <i>Pal Joey</i> (1957), which won him another Golden Globe. Toward the end of his career, he frequently played detectives, including the title character in <i>Tony Rome</i> (1967). Sinatra received the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award in 1971. On television, <i>The Frank Sinatra Show</i> began on CBS in 1950, and he continued to make appearances on television throughout the 1950s and 1960s.
</p><p>While Sinatra never learned how to read music, he worked very hard from a young age to improve his abilities in all aspects of music. A perfectionist, renowned for his style and presence, Sinatra always insisted on recording live with his band. He led a colorful personal life and was  involved in turbulent relationships, including his second marriage to Ava Gardner. He later married Mia Farrow in 1966 and Barbara Marx in 1976. Sinatra had several violent confrontations, often with journalists he felt had crossed him or work bosses with whom he had disagreements. He was deeply involved with politics starting in the mid-1940s and actively campaigned for presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan. Sinatra was investigated by the FBI for his alleged relationship with the mafia.
</p><p>Sinatra was honored at the Kennedy Center Honors in 1983, was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Ronald Reagan in 1985, and the Congressional Gold Medal in 1997. He received eleven Grammy Awards, including the Grammy Trustees Award, Grammy Legend Award and the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. Sinatra was included in <i>Time</i> magazine's compilation of the 20th century's 100 most influential people. American music critic Robert Christgau called him ""the greatest singer of the 20th century""  and he continues to be regarded as an iconic figure.</p>",

<p><b>Bon Jovi</b> is an American rock band formed in 1983 in Sayreville, New Jersey. It consists of singer Jon Bon Jovi, keyboardist David Bryan, drummer Tico Torres, guitarist Phil X, and bassist Hugh McDonald. Original bassist Alec John Such quit the band in 1994, and longtime guitarist and co-songwriter Richie Sambora left in 2013. The band has been credited with ""[bridging] the gap between heavy metal and pop with style and ease"".</p><p>In 1984 and 1985, Bon Jovi released their first two albums and their debut single ""Runaway"" managed to crack the Top 40. In 1986, the band achieved widespread success and global recognition with their third album, <i>Slippery When Wet</i>, which sold over 20 million copies and included three Top 10 singles, two of which reached No. 1 (""You Give Love a Bad Name"" and ""Livin' on a Prayer"") Their fourth album, <i>New Jersey</i> (1988), was also very successful, selling over 10 million copies and featuring five Top 10 singles (a record for a glam metal album), two of which reached No. 1 (""Bad Medicine"" and ""I'll Be There for You""). After the band toured and recorded extensively during the late 1980s, culminating in the 1988–1990 New Jersey Tour, Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora released successful solo albums in 1990 and 1991, respectively.
</p><p>In 1992, the band returned with the double-platinum <i>Keep the Faith</i>. This was followed by their biggest-selling and longest-charting single ""Always"" (1994) and the album <i>These Days</i> (1995), which proved to be a bigger success in Europe than in the United States, producing four Top Ten singles in the United Kingdom. Following a second hiatus, their 2000 album <i>Crush</i>, particularly the lead single, ""It's My Life"", successfully introduced the band to a younger audience, and the band considered this their comeback album. The band followed up with <i>Bounce</i> in 2002.  The platinum albums <i>Have a Nice Day</i> (2005)  and <i>Lost Highway</i> (2007) saw the band incorporate elements of country music into some of the songs, including the 2006 single ""Who Says You Can't Go Home"", which won the band a Grammy Award and became the first single by a rock band to reach No. 1 on the country charts. <i>The Circle</i> (2009) marked a return to the band's rock sound. The band also enjoyed great success touring, with both the 2005–2006 Have a Nice Day Tour and 2007–2008 Lost Highway Tour ranking among the Top 20 highest-grossing concert tours of the 2000s. After recording and releasing <i>Because We Can</i> in 2013, lead guitarist Richie Sambora left the band just before an April concert during the supporting tour to spend more time with his family. The band released their first studio album without Sambora, <i>Burning Bridges</i>, in 2015 and the follow-up album <i>This House Is Not For Sale</i> in 2016, the tour for which encompassed 2017–2019. Their most recent album <i>2020</i> (2020) was re-worked to include songs inspired by the COVID-19 pandemic and George Floyd protests; its  supporting tour was delayed to 2022.
</p><p>Bon Jovi has released 15 studio albums, five compilations and three live albums. They have sold more than 120 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling American rock bands, and performed more than 2,700 concerts in over 50 countries for more than 34 million fans. Bon Jovi was inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2006, and into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2018. The band received the Award of Merit at the American Music Awards in 2004, and Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2009.</p>",Sayreville

<p><b>The Shins</b> is an American indie rock band formed in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in 1996. The band is the project of singer-songwriter James Mercer, who has served as the band's sole constant member throughout numerous line-up changes. The band's current line-up consists of Mercer, alongside Yuuki Matthews (bass, keyboards), Mark Watrous (guitar, keyboards, lap steel), Patti King (keyboards), and Jon Sortland (drums). They are based in Portland, Oregon.
</p><p>The band was formed by Mercer as a side project to Flake Music, who were active from 1992 to 1999. Flake Music released two 7-inch singles and a full-length album, <i>When You Land Here It's Time to Return</i>, on Omnibus Records and were touring with Modest Mouse when the Shins became signed to Sub Pop Records. The Shins' first two records, <i>Oh, Inverted World</i> (2001) and <i>Chutes Too Narrow</i> (2003), performed well commercially and received critical acclaim. The single ""New Slang"" brought the band to mainstream attention when it was featured in the 2004 film <i>Garden State</i>. Consequently, the band's third album, <i>Wincing the Night Away</i> (2007), was a major success for the group, peaking at number two on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 and earning a Grammy Award nomination.
</p><p>Following this, the Shins signed to Columbia Records and Mercer parted ways with the entire original lineup, deeming it ""an aesthetic decision"". Following a near five-year hiatus, <i>Port of Morrow</i>, the band's fourth studio album, was released in 2012. Their fifth album, <i>Heartworms</i>, was released in March 2017.

<p><b>The Clash</b> were an English rock band formed in London in 1976 who were key players in the original wave of British punk rock. Billed as ""The Only Band That Matters"", they also contributed to the <span>post-punk</span> and new wave movements that emerged in the wake of punk and employed elements of a variety of genres including reggae, dub, funk, ska, and rockabilly. For most of their recording career, the Clash consisted of lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Joe Strummer, lead guitarist and vocalist Mick Jones, bassist Paul Simonon, and drummer Nicky ""Topper"" Headon. 
</p><p>Headon left the group in 1982 due to internal friction surrounding his increasing heroin addiction. Further internal friction led to Jones' departure the following year. The group continued with new members, but finally disbanded in early 1986.
The Clash achieved critical and commercial success in the United Kingdom with the release of their self-titled debut album, <i>The Clash</i> (1977) and their second album, <i>Give 'Em Enough Rope</i> (1978). Their experimental third album, <i>London Calling</i>, released in the UK in December 1979, earned them popularity in the United States when it was released there the following month. A decade later, <i>Rolling Stone</i> named it the best album of the 1980s. Following continued musical experimentation on their fourth album, <i>Sandinista!</i> (1980), the band reached new heights of success with the release of <i>Combat Rock</i> (1982), which spawned the US top 10 hit ""Rock the Casbah"", helping the album to achieve a 2× Platinum certification there. A final album, <i>Cut the Crap</i>, was released in 1985 with a new lineup, and a few weeks later, the band broke up.</p><p>In January 2003, shortly after the death of Joe Strummer, the band—including original drummer Terry Chimes—were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

</p>
<p><b>Pixies</b> is an American alternative rock band formed in 1986, in Boston, Massachusetts. Until 2013, the band consisted of Black Francis (vocals, rhythm guitar, songwriter), Joey Santiago (lead guitar), Kim Deal (bass, vocals) and David Lovering (drums). They disbanded acrimoniously in 1993 but reunited in 2004. After Deal left in 2013, Pixies hired Kim Shattuck as a touring bassist; she was replaced that year by Paz Lenchantin, who became a permanent member in 2016.
</p><p>Pixies is associated with the 1990s alternative rock boom, and draws on elements including punk rock and surf rock. Their music is known for dynamic ""loud-quiet-loud"" shifts and song structures. Francis is Pixies' primary songwriter; his often surreal lyrics cover offbeat subjects such as extraterrestrials, incest, and biblical violence. The band achieved modest popularity in the US but was more successful in Europe. Their jarring pop sound influenced acts such as Nirvana, Radiohead, The Smashing Pumpkins and Weezer. Pixies' popularity grew in the years after their breakup, leading to a 2004 reunion, sold-out world tours and four further albums: <i>Indie Cindy</i> (2014), <i>Head Carrier</i> (2016), <i>Beneath the Eyrie</i> (2019) and <i>Doggerel</i> (2022).

<p><b>Limp Bizkit</b> is an American rap rock  band from Jacksonville, Florida. Its lineup consists of lead vocalist Fred Durst, drummer John Otto, guitarist Wes Borland, turntablist DJ Lethal and bassist Sam Rivers. The band's music is marked by Durst's angry vocal delivery and Borland's sonic experimentation. Borland's elaborate visual appearance, which includes face and body paint, masks, and uniforms, also plays a large role in Limp Bizkit's live shows. The band has been nominated for three Grammy Awards, sold 40 million records worldwide, and won several other awards. The band has released 26 singles, the most notable of which include ""Nookie"", ""Re-Arranged"", ""Break Stuff"", ""Take a Look Around"", ""Rollin' (Air Raid Vehicle)"", ""My Generation"", ""My Way"", ""Eat You Alive"", and their cover of The Who's 1971 single ""Behind Blue Eyes"", all of which have charted within the top 20 of the US Alternative Airplay Chart.</p><p>Formed in 1994, Limp Bizkit became popular playing in the Jacksonville underground music scene in the late 1990s, and signed with Flip Records (with distribution from Interscope), who released the band's debut album, <i>Three Dollar Bill, Y'all</i> (1997). The band achieved mainstream success with its second and third studio albums, <i>Significant Other</i> (1999) and <i>Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water</i> (2000), although this success was marred by a series of controversies surrounding its performances at Woodstock '99 and the 2001 Big Day Out festival.
</p><p>Borland left the group in 2001, but Durst, Rivers, Otto, and Lethal continued to record and tour with guitarist Mike Smith.

</p><p>The Smiths signed to the independent label Rough Trade Records in 1983 and released their first album, <i>The Smiths</i>, in 1984. Their focus on a guitar, bass and drum sound, fusing 1960s rock and post-punk, was a rejection of the synth-pop sound that was predominant at the time. Several Smiths singles reached the top 20 of the UK Singles Chart, and all their studio albums reached the top five of the UK Albums Chart, including the number-one album <i>Meat Is Murder</i> (1985). They achieved mainstream success in Europe with <i>The Queen Is Dead</i> (1986) and <i>Strangeways, Here We Come</i> (1987), both of which entered the top 20 of the European Albums Chart.</p><p>Internal tensions led to the Smiths' breakup in 1987, followed by public lawsuits over royalties. Since the band's dissolution, the members have refused offers to reunite and have all separately stated that the band is finished and will never reunite.</p>",Manchester

</p>
<p><b>Interpol</b> is an American rock band from Manhattan, New York. Formed in 1997, their original line-up consisted of Paul Banks (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Daniel Kessler (lead guitar, backing vocals), Carlos Dengler (bass guitar, keyboards), and Greg Drudy (drums). Drudy left the band in 2000 and was replaced by Sam Fogarino. Dengler left to pursue other projects in 2010, with Banks taking on the additional role of bassist instead of hiring a new one.
</p><p>Having first performed at Luna Lounge alongside peers such as the Strokes, Longwave, the National, and Stellastarr, Interpol is one of the bands associated with the New York indie music scene and one of several groups that emerged from the post-punk revival of the 2000s. The band's sound is generally a mix of staccato bass and rhythmic, harmonized guitar with a snare-heavy mix, drawing comparisons to post-punk bands such as Joy Division, Television and The Chameleons, and also to Echo &amp; the Bunnymen and Siouxsie and the Banshees. The band has no primary songwriter, with each member contributing to composition.</p><p>Interpol's debut album <i>Turn On the Bright Lights</i> (2002) was critically acclaimed, making it to No. 10 on <i>NME</i><span>'s</span> list of the top albums of the year and No. 1 on Pitchfork Media's list of the top 50 albums of the year. Subsequent records <i>Antics</i> (2004) and <i>Our Love to Admire</i> (2007) brought greater critical and commercial success. The band released its self-titled fourth album in September 2010, then went on hiatus while they focused on other projects. Their fifth studio album, <i>El Pintor</i>, was released in September 2014. The band embarked on an anniversary tour for <i>Turn On the Bright Lights</i> in 2017, performing the album live in its entirety. The band's sixth studio album, <i>Marauder</i>, was released in August 2018, and their seventh, <i>The Other Side of Make-Believe</i>, in July 2022.

</p>
<p><b>Beastie Boys</b> were an American hip hop group from New York City, formed in 1978. The group was composed of Michael ""Mike D"" Diamond (vocals, drums), Adam ""MCA"" Yauch (vocals, bass), and Adam ""Ad-Rock"" Horovitz (vocals, guitar, programming). Beastie Boys were formed out of members of experimental hardcore punk band the Young Aborigines in 1978, with Diamond as vocalist, Jeremy Shatan on bass guitar, John Berry on guitar, and Kate Schellenbach on drums. When Shatan left in 1981, Yauch replaced him on bass and the band changed their name to Beastie Boys. Berry left shortly thereafter and was replaced by Horovitz.
</p><p>After achieving local success with the 1983 comedy hip hop single ""Cooky Puss"", Beastie Boys made a full transition to hip hop, and Schellenbach left. They toured with Madonna in 1985 and a year later released their debut album, <i>Licensed to Ill</i> (1986), the first rap record to top the <i>Billboard</i> 200 chart. Their second album, <i>Paul's Boutique</i> (1989), composed almost entirely of samples, was a commercial failure, but later received critical acclaim. <i>Check Your Head</i> (1992) and <i>Ill Communication</i> (1994) found mainstream success, followed by <i>Hello Nasty</i> (1998), <i>To the 5 Boroughs</i> (2004), <i>The Mix-Up</i> (2007), and <i>Hot Sauce Committee Part Two</i> (2011).
</p><p>Beastie Boys have sold 20 million records in the United States and had seven platinum-selling albums from 1986 to 2004. They are the biggest-selling rap group since <i>Billboard</i> began recording sales in 1991. In 2012, they became the third rap group to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In the same year, Yauch died of cancer and Beastie Boys disbanded. The remaining members have released several retrospective works, including a book, a documentary, and a career-spanning compilation album.

Furtado has sold over 40 million records worldwide making her one of the most successful Canadian artists. She is widely known for her musical versatility and genre experimentation.</p><p>She first gained fame with her trip hop-inspired debut album, <i>Whoa, Nelly!</i> (2000), which was a critical and commercial success that spawned two top-10 singles on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100, ""I'm Like a Bird"" and ""Turn Off the Light"". The first of the two singles won her a Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. Furtado's introspective folk-heavy 2003 second album, <i>Folklore</i>, explored her Portuguese roots. Its singles received moderate success in Europe, but the album's underperformance compared to her debut was regarded as a sophomore slump.
</p><p>Furtado's third album, <i>Loose</i> (2006), was a smash hit and became her bestselling album, with more than 10 million copies sold worldwide, also making it one of the bestselling albums of the 2000s. Considered a radical image reinvention, Furtado continued to explore her Portuguese heritage while leaning heavier into hip hop. The album spawned four successful number-one singles worldwide; ""Promiscuous"", ""Maneater"", ""Say It Right"", and ""All Good Things (Come to an End)"". Her Timbaland collaboration ""Give It to Me"" (2007) in the same era also topped the charts in the US and overseas.

In 2012, Furtado released her nostalgia-inspired fifth album <i>The Spirit Indestructible</i>.

</p>
<p><b>Brian Hugh Warner</b> (born January 5, 1969), known professionally as <b>Marilyn Manson</b>, is an American rock musician. He came to prominence as the lead singer of the band that shares his name, of which he remains the only constant member since its formation in 1989. Known for his controversial stage personality and public image, his stage name (like the other founding members of the band) was formed by combining the names of two opposing American cultural icons: actress Marilyn Monroe and cult leader Charles Manson.
</p><p>Manson is best known for music released in the 1990s, including the albums <i>Portrait of an American Family</i> (1994), <i>Antichrist Superstar</i> (1996) and <i>Mechanical Animals</i> (1998), which earned him a reputation in mainstream media as a controversial figure and negative influence on young people when combined with his public image. In the U.S. alone, three of the band's albums have been awarded platinum status and three more went gold, and the band has had eight releases debut in the top 10, including two No. 1 albums. Manson has been ranked at No. 44 on the list of the ""Top 100 Heavy Metal Vocalists"" by <i>Hit Parader</i> and, along with his band, has been nominated for four Grammy Awards–Manson himself earned an additional Grammy nomination for his work on Kanye West's <i>Donda</i>. Manson made his film debut as an actor in David Lynch's <i>Lost Highway</i> (1997), and has since appeared in a variety of minor roles and cameos. In 2002, his first art show, <i>The Golden Age of Grotesque</i>, was held at the Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions center.
</p><p>He is widely considered one of the most controversial figures in heavy metal music, and has been involved in numerous controversies throughout his career. His lyrics were criticized by American politicians and were examined in congressional hearings. Several U.S. states enacted legislation specifically banning the group from performing in state-operated venues. In 1999, news media falsely blamed Manson for influencing the perpetrators of the Columbine High School massacre. His work has been cited in several other violent events; his paintings and films appeared as evidence in a murder trial, and he has been accused of inspiring several other murders and school shootings. In 2021, multiple women accused Manson of psychologically and sexually abusing them, allegations he denied.</p>",

<p><b>The Prodigy</b> are an English electronic dance music band formed in Braintree, Essex, in 1990 by producer, keyboard player and songwriter Liam Howlett. The original line-up also featured dancer and singer Keith Flint and dancer and occasional live keyboard player Leeroy Thornhill, dancer Sharky and MC and vocalist Maxim. They were pioneers of the breakbeat-influenced genre big beat, and achieved mainstream popularity in the 1990s. Howlett's rock-inspired drum rhythms infused with electronic rave music beats/breaks were combined with Maxim's omnipresent mystique, Thornhill's shuffle dancing style, and Flint's later modern punk appearance. The Prodigy describe their style as electronic punk.</p><p>The band emerged during the underground rave scene and achieved early success in 1991 with their debut singles ""Charly"" and ""Everybody in the Place"", which reached the UK top five. After their debut album <i>Experience</i> (1992), the band moved from their rave roots and incorporated techno, breakbeat, and rock influences on their follow-up, the critically-acclaimed <i>Music for the Jilted Generation</i> (1994). The band reached their commercial and critical peak with their third studio album <i>The Fat of the Land</i> (1997), which went to No. 1 in 16 countries including the UK and the US, and spawned the UK number one singles ""Firestarter"" and ""Breathe"". The album's third single, ""Smack My Bitch Up"", was a UK top ten hit and generated considerable controversy over its suggestive lyrics and music video. <br>In July of 2022, the band completed their first tour since the death of frontman Keith Flint in March of 2019.
</p><p>The Prodigy remain one of the most successful electronic groups of all time. They have sold an estimated 25 million records worldwide, including over 4.7 million albums in the UK, and have scored seven consecutive UK number one albums. They earned titles like ""the premiere dance act for the alternative masses"" and ""the Godfathers of Rave"". The Prodigy have won numerous awards during their career, including two Brit Awards for Best British Dance Act, three MTV Video Music Awards, two Kerrang! Awards, five MTV Europe Music Awards, and two Grammy Award nominations.</p>",Braintree

</p>
<p><b>Audioslave</b> was an American rock supergroup formed in Glendale, California, in 2001. The four-piece band consisted of Soundgarden's lead singer and rhythm guitarist Chris Cornell with Rage Against the Machine members Tom Morello (lead guitar), Tim Commerford (bass/backing vocals), and Brad Wilk (drums). Critics first described Audioslave as a combination of Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine, but by the band's second album, <i>Out of Exile</i>, it was noted that they had established a separate identity. Their unique sound was created by blending 1970s hard rock and 1990s alternative rock, with musical influences that included 1960s funk, soul and R&amp;B. As with Rage Against the Machine, the band prided themselves on the fact that all sounds on their albums were produced using only guitars, bass, drums, and vocals, with emphasis on Cornell's wide vocal range and Morello's unconventional guitar solos.
</p><p>In their six years together, Audioslave released three albums, received three Grammy nominations, sold more than eight million records worldwide and became the first American rock band to perform an open-air concert in Cuba. They disbanded in February 2007 after Cornell issued a statement announcing that he was leaving the band. Later that year, Cornell and Morello released solo albums, and Morello, Commerford, and Wilk reunited with Zack de la Rocha for the Rage Against the Machine Reunion Tour.</p><p>Audioslave reunited to perform at Prophets of Rage's Anti-Inaugural Ball, which took place on January 20, 2017.  Cornell's death later that year precluded any chance of further reunions.

<p><b>Taylor Alison Swift</b> (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Her discography spans multiple genres, and her songwriting—often inspired by her personal life—has received critical praise and wide media coverage. Born in West Reading, Pennsylvania, Swift moved to Nashville at age 14 to become a country artist. She signed a songwriting deal with Sony/ATV Music Publishing in 2004 and a recording contract with Big Machine Records in 2005. Her 2006 self-titled debut album made her the first female country singer to write a U.S. platinum-certified album.
</p><p>Swift's next albums, <i>Fearless</i> (2008) and <i>Speak Now</i> (2010), explored country pop. The former's ""Love Story"" and ""You Belong with Me"" were the first country songs to top the U.S. pop and all-genre airplay charts, respectively. She experimented with rock and electronic styles on <i>Red</i> (2012), which featured her first <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 number-one song, ""We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together"", and eschewed her country image in her synth-pop album, <i>1989</i> (2014), supported by chart-topping songs ""Shake It Off"", ""Blank Space"", and ""Bad Blood"". Media scrutiny inspired the urban-flavored <i>Reputation</i> (2017) and its number-one single ""Look What You Made Me Do"".
</p><p>Exiting Big Machine, Swift signed with Republic Records in 2018 and released her seventh studio album, <i>Lover</i> (2019), followed by the autobiographical documentary <i>Miss Americana</i> (2020). She ventured into indie folk and alternative rock in her 2020 albums <i>Folklore</i> and <i>Evermore</i>, whose singles ""Cardigan"" and ""Willow"" topped the Hot 100. Swift began re-recording her first six albums after a dispute over their masters, re-releasing two in 2021—<i>Fearless (Taylor's Version)</i> and <i>Red (Taylor's Version)</i>. The latter's ""All Too Well (10 Minute Version)"" became the longest song to top the Hot 100. Her tenth original album <i>Midnights</i> (2022) and its single ""Anti-Hero"" broke all-time streaming records. Swift has directed music videos and films, such as <i>All Too Well: The Short Film</i> (2021), and played supporting roles in others.
</p><p>Having sold over 200 million records globally, Swift is one of the best-selling musicians in history. She is the most streamed woman on Spotify, and the only act to have five albums open with over one million copies sold in the US. Among her accolades are 12 Grammy Awards, including three Album of the Year wins; an Emmy Award; 40 American Music Awards; 29 <i>Billboard</i> Music Awards; and 92 <i>Guinness World Records</i>. Swift has been featured in rankings such as <i>Rolling Stone</i>'s 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time, <i>Billboard</i>'s Greatest of All Time Artists, the <i>Time</i> 100 and <i>Forbes</i> Celebrity 100. Honored with titles such as Artist of the Decade and Woman of the Decade, Swift is an advocate for artists' rights and women's empowerment. Her music is credited with influencing a generation of singer-songwriters.

</p>
<p><b>Panic! at the Disco</b> is the solo project of American musician Brendon Urie. It was originally a pop rock band from Las Vegas, Nevada, formed in 2004 by childhood friends Urie, Ryan Ross, Spencer Smith, and Brent Wilson. They recorded their first demos while they were in high school. Shortly after, the band recorded and released their debut studio album, <i>A Fever You Can't Sweat Out</i> (2005). Popularized by the second single, ""I Write Sins Not Tragedies"", the album was certified triple platinum in the US. In 2006, founding bassist Brent Wilson was fired from the band during an extensive world tour and subsequently replaced by Jon Walker. The band's second album, <i>Pretty. Odd.</i> (2008), was preceded by the single ""Nine in the Afternoon"". That album marked a significant departure from the sound of the band's debut. Ross and Walker, who favored the band's new direction, departed because Urie and Smith wanted to make further changes to the band's style. Ross and Walker subsequently formed a new band, the Young Veins, leaving Urie and Smith as the sole remaining members of Panic! at the Disco.
</p><p>Continuing as a duo, Urie and Smith released a new single, ""New Perspective"", for the movie <i>Jennifer's Body</i>, and recruited bassist Dallon Weekes and guitarist Ian Crawford as touring musicians for live performances. Weekes was later inducted into the band's lineup as a full-time member in 2010. The band's third studio album, <i>Vices &amp; Virtues</i> (2011), was recorded solely by Urie and Smith in 2010, produced by John Feldmann and Butch Walker. Crawford departed once the tour cycle for <i>Vices &amp; Virtues</i> ended in 2012.
</p><p>As a three-piece, Urie, Smith, and Weekes recorded and released the band's fourth studio album, <i>Too Weird to Live, Too Rare to Die!</i>, in 2013. Prior to the release of the album, Smith unofficially left the band due to health and drug-related issues, leaving Urie and Weekes as the remaining members. The duo recruited guitarist Kenneth Harris and drummer Dan Pawlovich as touring musicians for live performances.
</p><p>In 2015, Smith officially left the band after not performing live with them since his departure in 2013. Shortly thereafter, Weekes reverted to being a touring member once again, resulting in Panic! becoming Urie's solo project. In April 2015, ""Hallelujah"" was released as the first single from Panic! at the Disco's fifth studio album, <i>Death of a Bachelor</i> (2016). In December 2017, Weekes officially announced his departure from the band. In March 2018, Panic! at the Disco released ""Say Amen (Saturday Night)"", the lead single from its sixth studio album, <i>Pray for the Wicked</i> (2018), which was released in June. Panic! at the Disco's seventh studio album, <i>Viva Las Vengeance</i>, was released on August 19, 2022.
</p><p>On January 24, 2023, Urie officially announced that Panic! at the Disco would be disbanding following the conclusion of the Viva Las Vengeance Tour.

</p>
<p><b>Nine Inch Nails</b>, commonly abbreviated as <b>NIN</b> and stylized as <b>NIИ</b>, is an American industrial rock band formed in Cleveland in 1988. Singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and producer Trent Reznor was the only permanent member of the band until his frequent collaborator, Atticus Ross, joined in 2016. The band's debut album, <i>Pretty Hate Machine</i> (1989), was released via TVT Records. After disagreeing with TVT about how to promote the album, the band signed with Interscope Records and released the EP <i>Broken</i> (1992). The following albums, <i>The Downward Spiral</i> (1994) and <i>The Fragile</i> (1999), were released to critical acclaim and commercial success.
</p><p>Following a hiatus, Nine Inch Nails resumed touring in 2005 and released the album <i>With Teeth</i> (2005). Following the release of the album <i>Year Zero</i> (2007), the band left Interscope after a feud. Nine Inch Nails continued touring and independently released <i>Ghosts I–IV</i> (2008) and <i>The Slip</i> (2008) before a second hiatus. Their eighth album, <i>Hesitation Marks</i> (2013), was followed by a trilogy which consisted of the EPs <i>Not the Actual Events</i> (2016) and <i>Add Violence</i> (2017) and their ninth album <i>Bad Witch</i> (2018). In 2020, Nine Inch Nails simultaneously released two further instalments in the <i>Ghosts</i> series: <i>Ghosts V: Together</i> and <i>Ghosts VI: Locusts</i>.
</p><p>When touring, Reznor typically assembles a live band to perform with him under the Nine Inch Nails name. This live band has varied over the decades, with various members leaving and returning; the most recent lineup consists of Robin Finck (who initially joined in 1994), Alessandro Cortini (who initially joined in 2005), and Ilan Rubin (who initially joined in 2009) alongside Reznor and Ross. The band's concerts are noted for their extensive use of thematic visual elements, complex special effects, and elaborate lighting. Songs are often rearranged to fit any given performance, and melodies or lyrics of songs that are not scheduled to be performed are sometimes assimilated into other songs.
</p><p>Nine Inch Nails have sold over 20 million records and been nominated for 13 Grammy Awards, winning for the songs ""Wish"" in 1992 and ""Happiness in Slavery"" in 1996. <i>Time</i> magazine named Reznor one of its most influential people in 1997, while <i>Spin</i> magazine has described him as ""the most vital artist in music"". In 2004, <i>Rolling Stone</i> placed Nine Inch Nails at No. 94 on its list of the 100 greatest artists of all time. Nine Inch Nails were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2020, after being nominated in 2014 (their first year of eligibility) and again in 2015.

<p><b>Bruce Frederick Joseph Springsteen</b> (born September 23, 1949) is an American singer, songwriter, and musician. He has released 21 studio albums, most of which feature his backing band, the E Street Band. Originally from the Jersey Shore, he is an originator of heartland rock, combining mainstream rock musical styles with narrative songs about working class American life. Nicknamed ""<b>The Boss</b>"", his career has spanned six decades. Springsteen is known for his poetic, socially conscious lyrics and energetic stage performances, sometimes lasting up to four hours.</p><p>In 1973, Springsteen released his first two albums, <i>Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.</i> and <i>The Wild, the Innocent &amp; the E Street Shuffle</i>, neither of which earned him a large audience. He changed his style and reached worldwide popularity with <i>Born to Run</i> in 1975. It was followed by <i>Darkness on the Edge of Town</i> (1978) and <i>The River</i> (1980), which topped the US <i>Billboard</i> 200 chart. After the solo recording, <i>Nebraska</i> (1982), he reunited with the E Street Band for <i>Born in the U.S.A.</i> (1984), his most commercially successful album and one of the best-selling albums of all time. Seven of its singles reached the Top Ten of the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100, including the title track. Springsteen recorded his next three albums, <i>Tunnel of Love</i> (1987), <i>Human Touch</i> (1992), and <i>Lucky Town</i> (1992) using mostly session musicians. He reassembled the E Street Band for 1995's <i>Greatest Hits</i>, then recorded the sparse acoustic <i>The Ghost of Tom Joad</i>, followed by the EP <i>Blood Brothers</i> (1996), his last release of the decade.
</p><p>Springsteen dedicated his 2002 album <i>The Rising</i> to the victims of the September 11 attacks. He released two more folk albums, <i>Devils &amp; Dust</i> (2005) and <i>We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions</i> (2006), followed by two more albums with the E Street Band: <i>Magic</i> (2007) and <i>Working on a Dream</i> (2009). The next two, <i>Wrecking Ball</i> (2012) and <i>High Hopes</i> (2014), topped album charts worldwide. His latest releases include the solo <i>Western Stars</i> (2019), the E Street Band-featuring <i>Letter to You</i> (2020) and a solo cover album <i>Only the Strong Survive</i> (2022). When <i>Letter to You</i> went to No.2 in the US, Springsteen became the first artist to score a Top Five hit across six consecutive decades.</p><p>Among the album era's prominent acts, Springsteen has sold more than 140 million records worldwide and more than 71 million in the United States, making him one of the world's best-selling music artists. He has earned numerous awards for his work, including 20 Grammy Awards, two Golden Globes, an Academy Award, and a Special Tony Award (for <i>Springsteen on Broadway</i>). Springsteen was inducted into both the Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1999, received the Kennedy Center Honors in 2009, named MusiCares person of the year in 2013, and awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama in 2016.

</p>
<p><b>The Black Keys</b> are an American rock duo formed in Akron, Ohio, in 2001. The group consists of Dan Auerbach (guitar, vocals) and Patrick Carney (drums). The duo began as an independent act, recording music in basements and self-producing their records, before they eventually emerged as one of the most popular garage rock artists during a second wave of the genre's revival in the 2000s. The band's raw blues rock sound draws heavily from Auerbach's blues influences, including Junior Kimbrough, R.L. Burnside, Howlin' Wolf, and Robert Johnson.
</p><p>Friends since childhood, Auerbach and Carney founded the group after dropping out of college. After signing with indie label Alive, they released their debut album, <i>The Big Come Up</i> (2002), which earned them a new deal with Fat Possum Records. Over the next decade, the Black Keys built an underground fanbase through extensive touring of small clubs, frequent album releases and music festival appearances, and broad licensing of their songs. Their third album, <i>Rubber Factory</i> (2004), received critical acclaim and boosted the band's profile, eventually leading to a record deal with major label Nonesuch Records in 2006. After self-producing and recording their first four records in makeshift studios, the duo completed <i>Attack &amp; Release</i> (2008) in a professional studio and hired producer Danger Mouse, who subsequently became a frequent collaborator with the band.
</p><p>The group's commercial breakthrough came in 2010 with <i>Brothers</i>, which along with its popular single ""Tighten Up"", won three Grammy Awards. Their 2011 follow-up <i>El Camino</i> received strong reviews and peaked at number two on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 chart, leading to the first arena concert tour of the band's career, the El Camino Tour. The album and its hit single ""Lonely Boy"" won three Grammy Awards. In 2014, they released their eighth album, <i>Turn Blue</i>, their first number-one record in the US, Canada, and Australia. After completing the Turn Blue Tour in 2015, the duo took a hiatus for several years to work on side projects and produce other artists. They returned in 2019 with their ninth album, <i>Let's Rock</i>; their tenth studio album <i>Delta Kream</i> was released in 2021 and consists of hill country blues covers.</p>

</p>
<p><b>Fleetwood Mac</b> are a British-American rock band, formed in London in 1967. Fleetwood Mac were founded by guitarists and vocalists Peter Green and Jeremy Spencer, and drummer Mick Fleetwood. Bob Brunning was hired as a temporary bass guitarist before John McVie joined the line-up in time for their eponymous debut album. Danny Kirwan joined as a third guitarist and vocalist in 1968. Keyboardist and vocalist Christine Perfect, who contributed as a session musician from the second album onwards, married McVie and joined in 1970, becoming known as Christine McVie.
</p><p>Primarily a British blues band at first, Fleetwood Mac achieved a UK number one with ""Albatross"", and had other hits such as the singles ""Oh Well"", ""Man of the World"", and ""The Green Manalishi"". Green, Spencer and Kirwan all left in succession during the early 1970s, replaced by guitarist and vocalist Bob Welch, guitarist Bob Weston and vocalist Dave Walker. By 1974, Welch, Weston and Walker had all either departed or been dismissed, leaving the band without a male vocalist or a guitarist. In late 1974, while Fleetwood was scouting studios in Los Angeles, he heard the American folk-rock duo Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks. He asked Buckingham to be their new guitarist and vocalist with Buckingham agreeing on the condition that Nicks could also join as vocalist.
</p><p>The addition of Buckingham and Nicks gave the band a more pop rock sound and their 1975 album <i>Fleetwood Mac</i> reached No. 1 in the United States. <i>Rumours</i> (1977) produced four U.S. Top 10 singles and remained at number one on the American albums chart for 31 weeks. It also reached the top spot in countries around the world and won a Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1978. <i>Rumours</i> has sold more than 40 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums in history. Although each member of the band went through a breakup (John and Christine McVie, Buckingham and Nicks, and Fleetwood and his wife Jenny) while recording the album, they continued to write and record together.
</p><p>The lineup remained stable through three more studio albums, but by the late 1980s began to disintegrate. After Buckingham and Nicks left, they were replaced by a number of other guitarists and vocalists. A 1993 one-off performance for the first inauguration of President Bill Clinton reunited Fleetwood, Nicks and Buckingham, and John and Christine McVie for the first time in six years. A full reunion occurred four years later, and Fleetwood Mac released their fourth U.S. No. 1 album, <i>The Dance</i> (1997), a live compilation of their hits, also marking the 20th anniversary of <i>Rumours</i>. Christine McVie left in 1998, but continued to work with the band in a session capacity. They continued as a four-piece, releasing their most recent studio album, <i>Say You Will</i>, in 2003. Christine McVie rejoined in 2014. In 2018, Buckingham was fired and replaced by Mike Campbell, formerly of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers and Neil Finn of Split Enz and Crowded House. Christine McVie died in 2022.
</p><p>Fleetwood Mac have sold more than 120 million records worldwide, making them one of the world's best-selling bands. In 1979, the group were honoured with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 1998 the band were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and received the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. In 2018, the band received the MusiCares Person of the Year award from The Recording Academy in recognition of their artistic achievement in the music industry and dedication to philanthropy.

<p><b>Stevland Hardaway Morris</b> (<span title=""Name at birth"">né </span> <b>Judkins</b>; May 13, 1950), known professionally as <b>Stevie Wonder</b>, is an American singer-songwriter, who is credited as a pioneer and influence by musicians across a range of genres that include rhythm and blues, pop, soul, gospel, funk, and jazz. A virtual one-man band, Wonder's use of synthesizers and other electronic musical instruments during the 1970s reshaped the conventions of R&amp;B. He also helped drive such genres into the album era, crafting his LPs as cohesive and consistent, in addition to socially conscious statements with complex compositions. Blind since shortly after his birth, Wonder was a child prodigy who signed with Motown's Tamla label at the age of 11, where he was given the professional name <b>Little Stevie Wonder</b>.
</p><p>Wonder's single ""Fingertips"" was a No. 1 hit on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 in 1963, at the age of 13, making him the youngest artist ever to top the chart. Wonder's critical success was at its peak in the 1970s. His ""classic period"" began in 1972 with the releases of <i>Music of My Mind</i> and <i>Talking Book</i>, the latter featuring ""Superstition"", which is one of the most distinctive and famous examples of the sound of the Hohner Clavinet keyboard. His works <i>Innervisions</i> (1973), <i>Fulfillingness' First Finale</i> (1974) and <i>Songs in the Key of Life</i> (1976) all won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year, making him the tied-record holder for the most Album of the Year wins, with three. He is also the only artist to have won the award with three consecutive album releases. Wonder began his ""commercial period"" in the 1980s; he achieved his biggest hits and highest level of fame, had increased album sales, charity participation, high-profile collaborations (including Paul McCartney and Michael Jackson), political impact, and television appearances. Wonder has continued to remain active in music and political causes.
</p><p>Wonder is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with sales of over 100 million records worldwide. He has won 25 Grammy Awards (the most by a solo artist) and one Academy Award (Best Original Song, for the 1984 film <i>The Woman in Red</i>). Wonder has been inducted into the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Songwriters Hall of Fame. He is also noted for his work as an activist for political causes, including his 1980 campaign to make Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday a federal holiday in the U.S. In 2009, he was named a United Nations Messenger of Peace, and in 2014, he was honored with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

<p><b>Dire Straits</b> were a English rock band formed in London in 1977 by Mark Knopfler (lead vocals and lead guitar), David Knopfler (rhythm guitar and backing vocals), John Illsley (bass guitar and backing vocals) and Pick Withers (drums and percussion). They were active from 1977 to 1988 and again from 1990 to 1995.</p><p>Their first single, ""Sultans of Swing"", from their 1978 self-titled debut album, reached the top ten in the UK and US charts. It was followed by hit singles including ""Romeo and Juliet"" (1981), ""Private Investigations"" (1982), ""Twisting by the Pool"" (1983), ""Money for Nothing"" (1985), and ""Walk of Life"" (1985). Their most commercially successful album, <i>Brothers in Arms</i> (1985), has sold more than 30 million copies; it was the first album to sell a million copies on compact disc and is the eighth-bestselling album in UK history.  According to the <i>Guinness Book of British Hit Albums</i>, Dire Straits have spent over 1,100 weeks on the UK albums chart, the fifth most of all time.</p><p>Dire Straits' sound draws from various influences, including country, folk, the blues rock of J. J. Cale, and jazz. Their stripped-down sound contrasted with punk rock and demonstrated a roots rock influence that emerged from pub rock. There were several changes in personnel, with Mark Knopfler and Illsley being the only members who lasted from the beginning of the band's existence to the end. After their first breakup in 1988, Knopfler told <i>Rolling Stone</i>: ""A lot of press reports were saying we were the biggest band in the world. There's not an accent then on the music, there's an accent on popularity. I needed a rest."" They disbanded for good in 1995, after which Knopfler launched a solo career full-time. He has since declined numerous reunion offers.</p><p>Dire Straits were called ""the biggest British rock band of the 80s"" by <i>Classic Rock</i> magazine; their 1985–1986 world tour, which included a performance at Live Aid in July 1985, set a record in Australasia. Their final world tour from 1991 to 1992 sold 7.1 million tickets. Dire Straits won four Grammy Awards, three Brit Awards (Best British Group twice), two MTV Video Music Awards, and various other awards. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2018. Dire Straits have sold over 120 million units worldwide, including 51.4 million certified units, making them one of the best-selling music artists.</p>",Deptford

</p>
<p><b>Deep Purple</b> are an English rock band formed in London in 1968. They are considered to be among the pioneers of heavy metal and modern hard rock, but their musical approach has changed over the years. Originally formed as a psychedelic rock and progressive rock band, they shifted to a heavier sound with their 1970 album <i>Deep Purple in Rock</i>. Deep Purple, together with Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath, have been referred to as the ""unholy trinity of British hard rock and heavy metal in the early to mid-seventies"". They were listed in the 1975 <i>Guinness Book of World Records</i> as ""the globe's loudest band"" for a 1972 concert at London's Rainbow Theatre and have sold over 100 million albums worldwide.</p><p>Deep Purple have had several line-up changes and an eight-year hiatus (1976–1984). The first four line-ups, which constituted the band's original 1968–1976 run, are officially indicated as Mark I (1968–1969), Mark II (1969–1973), Mark III (1973–1975) and Mark IV (1975–1976). Mark I comprised the founding members of Deep Purple, Ritchie Blackmore (guitar), Rod Evans (vocals), Jon Lord (keyboards), Ian Paice (drums) and Nick Simper (bass), while Mark II was the most commercially successful line-up, with Ian Gillan (vocals) and Roger Glover (bass) replacing Evans and Simper. Mark III saw David Coverdale (vocals) and Glenn Hughes (bass and vocals) replace Gillan and Glover, while Mark IV featured Tommy Bolin (guitar) replacing Blackmore. Mark II was revived from 1984–1989 and again from 1992–1993, with Joe Lynn Turner (vocals) replacing Gillan in the intervening 1989–1992 period. Mark II definitively ended in 1993, when Blackmore left Deep Purple for the second and final time. He was replaced temporarily by Joe Satriani (guitar) and then permanently by Steve Morse (guitar). In 2002 Don Airey (keyboards) replaced Lord, which saw Deep Purple settle into its longest running line-up, unchanged for the next twenty years, until Morse announced his departure from the band in 2022. His place was taken by Simon McBride (guitar). Ian Paice, Roger Glover, Ian Gillan, Don Airey and Simon McBride comprise the current line-up of Deep Purple.
</p><p>Deep Purple were ranked number 22 on VH1's <i>Greatest Artists of Hard Rock</i> programme, and a poll on radio station Planet Rock ranked them 5th among the ""most influential bands ever"". The band received the Legend Award at the 2008 World Music Awards. Deep Purple (specifically Blackmore, Lord, Paice, Gillan, Glover, Coverdale, Evans, and Hughes) were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2016.

<p><b>Iron Maiden</b> are an English heavy metal band formed in Leyton, East London, in 1975 by bassist and primary songwriter Steve Harris. Although fluid in the early years of the band, the lineup for most of the band's history has consisted of Harris, lead vocalist Bruce Dickinson, drummer Nicko McBrain, and guitarists Dave Murray, Adrian Smith and Janick Gers. The band have released 41 albums, including 17 studio albums, 13 live albums, four EPs and seven compilations. They have also released 47 singles and 20 video albums. Two electronic games have been released with Iron Maiden soundtracks, and the band's music is featured in a number of other video games.
</p><p>As pioneers of the new wave of British heavy metal movement, Iron Maiden achieved initial success during the early 1980s. After several lineup changes, the band went on to release a series of UK and US Platinum and Gold albums, including 1980's eponymous debut album, 1981's <i>Killers</i>, 1982's <i>The Number of the Beast</i>, 1983's <i>Piece of Mind</i>, 1984's <i>Powerslave</i>, 1985's live release <i>Live After Death</i>, 1986's <i>Somewhere in Time</i>, 1988's <i>Seventh Son of a Seventh Son</i>, 1990's <i>No Prayer for the Dying</i> and 1992's <i>Fear of the Dark</i>. In 1982, the band released <i>The Number of the Beast</i> – its first album with Bruce Dickinson, who replaced Paul Di'Anno as lead singer – which was a turning point in their career, helping establish them as one of heavy metal's most important artists. <i>The Number of the Beast</i> is among the most popular heavy metal albums of all time, having sold almost 20 million copies worldwide.</p><p>Since the return of lead vocalist Bruce Dickinson and guitarist Adrian Smith in 1999, the band has undergone a resurgence in popularity, with a series of new albums and highly successful tours. Released in 2006, <i>A Matter of Life and Death</i>, their 14th studio album, reached top sales in dozens of countries, initiating the series of Iron Maiden's highest-ranked albums. Their 2010 album, <i>The Final Frontier</i>, peaked at No. 1 in 28 countries and received widespread critical acclaim. Their 16th studio album, <i>The Book of Souls</i>, was released on 4 September 2015 to similar success, debuting at No. 1 in the album charts of 24 countries with physical sales and summary in 43 territories with physical and digital sales.

</p>
<p><b>The Kinks</b> were an English rock band formed in Muswell Hill, North London, in 1963 by brothers Ray and Dave Davies. They are regarded as one of the most influential rock bands of the 1960s. The band emerged during the height of British rhythm and blues and Merseybeat, and were briefly part of the British Invasion of the United States until their touring ban in 1965. Their third single, the Ray Davies-penned ""You Really Got Me"", became an international hit, topping the charts in the United Kingdom and reaching the Top 10 in the United States.</p><p>The Kinks' music drew from a wide range of influences, including American R&amp;B and rock and roll initially, and later adopting British music hall, folk, and country. The band gained a reputation for reflecting English culture and lifestyle, fuelled by Ray Davies' wittily observational writing style, and made apparent in albums such as <i>Face to Face</i> (1966), <i>Something Else</i> (1967), <i>The Village Green Preservation Society</i> (1968), <i>Arthur</i> (1969), <i>Lola Versus Powerman</i> (1970), and <i>Muswell Hillbillies</i> (1971), along with their accompanying singles including the transatlantic hit ""Lola"" (1970). After a fallow period in the mid-1970s, the band experienced a revival during the late 1970s and early 1980s with their albums <i>Sleepwalker</i> (1977), <i>Misfits</i> (1978), <i>Low Budget</i> (1979), <i>Give the People What They Want</i> (1981) and <i>State of Confusion</i> (1983), the last of which produced one of the band's most successful US hits, ""Come Dancing"". In addition, groups such as Van Halen, the Jam, the Knack, the Pretenders and the Romantics covered their songs, helping to boost the Kinks' record sales. In the 1990s, Britpop acts such as Blur and Oasis cited the band as a major influence.</p><p>The original line-up comprised Ray Davies (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Dave Davies (lead guitar, vocals), Mick Avory (drums, percussion) and Pete Quaife (bass). The Davies brothers remained with the band throughout its history. Quaife was replaced by John Dalton in 1969, with keyboardist John Gosling being added in 1970 (prior to this, session keyboardist Nicky Hopkins played on many of their recordings). After Dalton's 1976 departure, Andy Pyle briefly served as the band's bassist before being replaced by Argent bassist Jim Rodford in 1978. Gosling quit in 1978 and was first replaced by ex-Pretty Things member Gordon Edwards, then more permanently by Ian Gibbons in 1979. Avory left the group in 1984 and was replaced by another Argent member Bob Henrit. The band gave its last public performance in 1996 and broke up in 1997 as a result of creative tension between the Davies brothers.</p><p>The Kinks have had five Top 10 singles on the US <i>Billboard</i> chart. Nine of their albums charted in the Top 40. In the UK, they have had seventeen Top 20 singles and five Top 10 albums. Four Kinks albums have been certified gold by the RIAA and the band have sold 50 million records worldwide. Among numerous honours, they received the Ivor Novello Award for ""Outstanding Service to British Music"". In 1990, the original four members of the Kinks were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, as well as the UK Music Hall of Fame in November 2005. In 2018, after years of ruling out a reunion due to the brothers' animosity and the difficult relationship between longtime drummer Mick Avory and Dave, Ray and Dave Davies finally announced they were working to reform the Kinks, with Avory also on board. However, comments made by each of the Davies brothers in 2020 and 2021 would indicate that in the years since the initial announcement, little (if any) progress has been made towards an actual Kinks reunion for a new studio band album.</p>",Muswell Hill

<p><b>Jennifer Lynn Affleck</b> (<i><span title=""Name at birth"">née </span></i> <b>Lopez</b>;  born July 24, 1969), also known as <b>J.Lo</b>, is an American actress, singer and dancer. In 1991, she began appearing as a Fly Girl dancer on the sketch comedy television series <i>In Living Color</i>, where she remained a regular until she decided to pursue an acting career in 1993. For her first leading role in <i>Selena</i> (1997), she became the first Hispanic actress to earn over US$1 million for a film. She went on to star in <i>Anaconda</i> (1997) and <i>Out of Sight</i> (1998), and established herself as the highest-paid Hispanic actress in Hollywood.</p><p>Lopez ventured into the music industry with her debut studio album <i>On the 6</i> (1999), which helped propel the Latin pop movement in American music, and later starred in the psychological horror <i>The Cell</i> (2000). With the simultaneous release of her second studio album <i>J.Lo</i> and her romantic comedy <i>The Wedding Planner</i> in 2001, she became the first woman to have a number-one album and film in the same week. Her 2002 release, <i>J to tha L–O! The Remixes</i>, became the first remix album in history to debut atop the US <i>Billboard</i> 200. Later that year, she released her third studio album, <i>This Is Me... Then</i> and starred in the film <i>Maid in Manhattan</i>.
</p><p>After starring in <i>Gigli</i> (2003), a critical and commercial failure, Lopez starred in the successful romantic comedies <i>Shall We Dance?</i> (2004) and <i>Monster-in-Law</i> (2005). Her fifth studio album, <i>Como Ama una Mujer</i> (2007), had the highest first week sales for a debut Spanish album in the United States. Following a relatively unsuccessful period, she returned to prominence in 2011 with her appearance as a judge on <i>American Idol</i> and released her seventh studio album, <i>Love?</i>. From 2016 to 2018, she starred in the police drama series <i>Shades of Blue</i> and performed a residency show, Jennifer Lopez: All I Have, at Planet Hollywood Las Vegas. She also produced and served as a judge on <i>World of Dance</i> (2017–2020). In 2019, she garnered critical acclaim for her performance as a stripper in the crime drama <i>Hustlers</i>.
</p><p>Lopez is considered a pop culture icon, and is often described as a triple threat entertainer. With a cumulative film gross of US$3.1 billion and estimated global sales of 80 million records, she is considered the most influential Hispanic entertainer in North America. In 2012, <i>Forbes</i> ranked her the world's most powerful celebrity, and the 38th most powerful woman in the world. <i>Time</i> listed her among their 100 most influential people in the world in 2018. Her most successful singles on the US <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 include ""If You Had My Love"", ""I'm Real"", ""Ain't It Funny"", ""All I Have"" and ""On the Floor"". For her contributions to the recording industry, she has a landmark star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and has received the <i>Billboard</i> Icon Award and the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award, among other honors. Her other ventures include beauty and clothing lines, fragrances, a production company and a charitable foundation.</p>",

<p><b>Portishead</b> (<span></span>) is an English band formed in 1991 in Bristol. The band is named after Portishead, Somerset, eight miles west of Bristol, along the coast. The band comprises vocalist Beth Gibbons, producer Geoff Barrow, and musician Adrian Utley; Dave McDonald, an engineer on their first records, is sometimes cited as the fourth member.</p><p>Portishead's debut album, <i>Dummy</i> (1994), fused hip hop production with yearning vocals from Gibbons and an atmospheric, cinematic style reminiscent of spy film soundtracks. The album was met with commercial and critical acclaim, quickly becoming a landmark album in the emerging trip hop genre. However, the band disliked being associated with the term, and would consciously step away from that sound on later releases. Two other studio albums have been issued: <i>Portishead</i> in 1997 and <i>Third</i> in 2008, both of which received similar acclaim. In 1998, the band released a concert album, <i>Roseland NYC Live</i>.

<p>The <b>Eagles</b> are an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1971. With five number-one singles and six number-one albums, six Grammy Awards and five American Music Awards, the Eagles were one of the most successful musical acts of the 1970s in North America. Founding members Glenn Frey (guitars, vocals), Don Henley (drums, vocals), Bernie Leadon (guitars, vocals), and Randy Meisner (bass guitar, vocals) were recruited by Linda Ronstadt as band members, some touring with her, and all playing on her third solo album, before venturing out on their own on David Geffen's new Asylum Records label.
</p><p>Their debut album, <i>Eagles</i> (1972), spawned two top-20 singles in the US and Canada: ""Take It Easy"" and ""Witchy Woman"". The next year's follow-up album, <i>Desperado</i>, peaked at only number 41 in the US, although the song ""Desperado"" became a popular track. In 1974, guitarist Don Felder joined, and <i>On the Border</i> produced the top-40 hit ""Already Gone"" and the Eagles' first number-one song in the US and Canada, ""Best of My Love"", which made the top 15 in Australia, their first hit overseas. In 1975, the album <i>One of These Nights</i> became their first number-one album in the US and a top-10 album in many countries. It included the US number-one hit ""One of These Nights"", which was their first top-10 hit outside of North America, and US top-five songs ""Lyin' Eyes"" and ""Take It to the Limit"". Also in 1975, guitarist and vocalist Joe Walsh replaced Leadon.
</p><p><i>Their Greatest Hits (1971–1975)</i> (1976) is the best-selling album in the United States, with 38 million sold, and primed the public for the late 1976 release of <i>Hotel California</i>, which would sell more than 26<span> </span>million copies in the US (ranking third all-time for US sales), and more than 32<span> </span>million copies worldwide. The album yielded two number-one singles in the US and Canada, ""New Kid in Town"" and ""Hotel California"", the latter of which became their only top-10 hit in the United Kingdom, while also reaching the top 10 in New Zealand and many European countries, including number two in France.
</p><p>Meisner was replaced by Timothy B. Schmit in 1977. The Eagles released their last studio album for nearly 28 years in 1979 with <i>The Long Run</i>, spawning the North American number-one song ""Heartache Tonight"", which became their biggest hit in Australia (number 13), and the North American top-10 hits ""The Long Run"" and ""I Can't Tell You Why"". The Eagles broke up in 1980 but reunited in 1994 for the album <i>Hell Freezes Over</i>, a mix of live and new studio tracks, and toured consistently. In 2007, the Eagles released <i>Long Road Out of Eden</i>, their sixth number-one album in the US, and in 2008 launched the Long Road Out of Eden Tour. In 2013, they began the extended History of the Eagles Tour in conjunction with the documentary release, <i>History of the Eagles</i>. Following Frey's death in January 2016, the Eagles re-formed in 2017, with Glenn's son Deacon Frey and Vince Gill sharing lead vocals for Frey's songs prior to the former's departure in 2022.</p><p>The Eagles are one of the world's best-selling bands, having sold more than 200<span> </span>million records, including 100<span> </span>million sold in US alone. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998 and were ranked number 75 on <i>Rolling Stone</i><span>'</span>s 2004 list of the ""100 Greatest Artists of All Time"".</p>

<p><b>Christopher George Latore Wallace</b> (May 21, 1972 – March 9, 1997), better known by his stage names <b>the Notorious B.I.G.</b>, <b>Biggie Smalls</b>, or simply <b>Biggie</b>, was an American rapper. Rooted in East Coast hip hop and particularly gangsta rap, he is cited in various media lists as being one of the greatest rappers of all time. Wallace became known for his distinctive laid-back lyrical delivery, offsetting the lyrics' often grim content. His music was often semi-autobiographical, telling of hardship and criminality, but also of debauchery and celebration.</p><p>Born and raised in Brooklyn, New York City, Wallace signed to Sean ""Puffy"" Combs' label Bad Boy Records as it launched in 1993, and gained exposure through features on several other artists' singles that year. His debut album <i>Ready to Die</i> (1994) was met with widespread critical acclaim, and included his signature songs ""Juicy"" and ""Big Poppa"". The album made him the central figure in East Coast hip hop, and restored New York's visibility at a time when the West Coast hip hop scene was dominating hip hop music. Wallace was awarded the 1995 <i>Billboard</i> Music Awards' Rapper of the Year. The following year, he led his protégé group Junior M.A.F.I.A., a team of himself and longtime friends, including Lil' Kim, to chart success.
</p><p>During 1996, while recording his second album, Wallace became ensnarled in the escalating East Coast–West Coast hip hop feud. Following Tupac Shakur's death in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas in September 1996, speculations of involvement in Shakur's murder by criminal elements orbiting the Bad Boy circle circulated as a result of Wallace's public feud with Shakur. On March 9, 1997, six months after Shakur's death, Wallace was murdered by an unidentified assailant in a drive-by shooting while visiting Los Angeles. Wallace's second album <i>Life After Death</i>, a double album, was released two weeks later. It reached number one on the <i>Billboard</i> 200, and eventually achieved a diamond certification in the United States.</p><p>With two more posthumous albums released, Wallace has certified sales of over 28 million copies in the United States, including 21 million albums. <i>Rolling Stone</i> has called him the ""greatest rapper that ever lived"", and <i>Billboard</i> named him the greatest rapper of all time. <i>The Source</i> magazine named him the greatest rapper of all time in its 150th issue. In 2006, MTV ranked him at No. 3 on their list of <i>The Greatest MCs of All Time</i>, calling him possibly ""the most skillful ever on the mic"". In 2020, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

</p>
<p><b>The Pussycat Dolls</b> were an American girl group and dance ensemble, founded in Los Angeles, California, by choreographer Robin Antin in 1995 as a burlesque troupe. At the suggestion of Jimmy Iovine, Antin decided to take the burlesque troupe mainstream as a pop group. Antin negotiated a record deal with Interscope Geffen A&amp;M Records in 2003 turning the group into a music franchise comprising Nicole Scherzinger, Carmit Bachar, Ashley Roberts, Jessica Sutta, Melody Thornton, and Kimberly Wyatt. Their debut single, ""Sway"", was featured on the soundtrack of the 2004 film <i>Shall We Dance?</i>.
</p><p>The Pussycat Dolls achieved worldwide success with the singles ""Don't Cha"", ""Stickwitu"", ""Buttons"", and their multi-platinum debut album <i>PCD</i> (2005). However, despite their commercial success, the group was plagued by internal conflict due to the emphasis on Scherzinger, the group's lead vocalist, and the subordinate treatment of the other members. Bachar's departure from the group preceded the release of their second and final studio album <i>Doll Domination</i> (2008), which contains hit singles ""When I Grow Up"", ""I Hate This Part"", and ""Jai Ho! (You Are My Destiny)"". Following the completion of their 2009 world tour, the group went on hiatus and fully disbanded in 2010. The original recording line-up, minus Thornton, announced their reunion in 2019 with an upcoming tour and a new album. However, with the worsening situation arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, along with breaches of contracts and logistical issues, the reunion tour was cancelled in 2022, leaving the group's fate uncertain.
</p><p>The Pussycat Dolls brand diversified into merchandise, reality television programs, a Las Vegas act, product endorsements, spin-off recording groups (Girlicious, Paradiso Girls, G.R.L.), and other ventures. <i>Billboard</i> ranked the Pussycat Dolls as the 80th most successful musical act of the 2000s. The group has sold 55 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling girl groups of all time. In 2012, the Pussycat Dolls ranked 100th on VH1's 100 Greatest Women in Music, and as the tenth all-girl group.</p>

<p><b>Robert Nesta Marley</b>  (6 February 1945 – 11 May 1981) was a Jamaican singer,  musician, and songwriter. Considered one of the pioneers of reggae, his musical career was marked by fusing elements of reggae, ska, and rocksteady, as well as his distinctive vocal and songwriting style. Marley's contributions to music increased the visibility of Jamaican music worldwide, and made him a global figure in popular culture to this day. Over the course of his career, Marley became known as a Rastafari icon, and he infused his music with a sense of spirituality. He is also considered a global symbol of Jamaican music and culture and identity, and was controversial in his outspoken support for democratic social reforms. In 1976, Marley survived an assassination attempt in his home, which was thought to be politically motivated. He also supported legalisation of marijuana, and advocated for Pan-Africanism.</p><p>Born in Nine Mile, Jamaica, Marley began his professional musical career in 1963, after forming the Teenagers with Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer, which after several name changes would become the Wailers. The group released its debut studio album <i>The Wailing Wailers</i> in 1965, which contained the single ""One Love"", a reworking of ""People Get Ready""; the song was popular worldwide, and established the group as a rising figure in reggae. The Wailers released a further eleven studio albums, and after signing to Island Records the band's name became Bob Marley and the Wailers. While initially employing louder instrumentation and singing, the group began engaging in rhythmic-based song construction in the late 1960s and early 1970s, which coincided with Marley's conversion to Rastafari. Around this time, Marley relocated to London, and the group embodied their musical shift with the release of the album <i>The Best of The Wailers</i> (1971).</p><p>The group started to gain international attention after signing to Island, and touring in support of the albums <i>Catch a Fire</i> and <i>Burnin'</i> (both 1973). Following the disbandment of the Wailers a year later, Marley carried on under the band's name. The album <i>Natty Dread</i> (1974) received positive reception. In 1975, following the global popularity of Eric Clapton's version of Marley's ""I Shot the Sheriff"",  Marley had his international breakthrough with his first hit outside Jamaica, with a live version of ""No Woman, No Cry"", from the <i>Live!</i> album. This was followed by his breakthrough album in the United States, <i>Rastaman Vibration</i> (1976), which reached the Top 50 of the Billboard Soul Charts. A few months after the album's release Marley survived an assassination attempt at his home in Jamaica, which prompted him to permanently relocate to London. During his time in London he recorded the album <i>Exodus</i> (1977); it incorporated elements of blues, soul, and British rock and enjoyed widespread commercial and critical success. In 1977, Marley was diagnosed with acral lentiginous melanoma; he died as a result of the illness in 1981, shortly after baptism into the Ethiopian Orthodox Church.  His fans around the world expressed their grief, and he received a state funeral in Jamaica.
</p><p>The greatest hits album <i>Legend</i> was released in 1984, and became the best-selling reggae album of all time. Marley also ranks as one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with estimated sales of more than 75 million records worldwide. He was posthumously honoured by Jamaica soon after his death with a designated Order of Merit by his nation. In 1994, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. <i>Rolling Stone</i> ranked him No. 11 on its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. His other achievements include a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and induction into the Black Music &amp; Entertainment Walk of Fame.

</p>
<p><b>Breaking Benjamin</b> is an American rock band from Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, formed in 1999 by lead singer and guitarist Benjamin Burnley and drummer Jeremy Hummel. The first lineup of the band also included guitarist Aaron Fink and bassist Mark Klepaski. This lineup released two albums, <i>Saturate</i> (2002) and <i>We Are Not Alone</i> (2004), before Hummel was replaced by Chad Szeliga in 2005. The band released two more studio albums, <i>Phobia</i> (2006) and <i>Dear Agony</i> (2009), before entering an extended hiatus in early 2010 due to Burnley's recurring illnesses.</p><p>Amid the hiatus, the release of a compilation album, <i>Shallow Bay: The Best of Breaking Benjamin</i> (2011), unauthorized by Burnley, brought about legal trouble within the band resulting in the dismissal of Fink and Klepaski. Szeliga later announced his departure in 2013 citing creative differences. Burnley remained the sole member of the band until late 2014, when the current lineup was announced, including bassist and backing vocalist Aaron Bruch, guitarist and backing vocalist Keith Wallen, guitarist Jasen Rauch, and drummer Shaun Foist. The band afterward released <i>Dark Before Dawn</i> (2015) and <i>Ember</i> (2018), which debuted at number one and three on the <i>Billboard</i> 200, respectively. Following these albums, the band released another compilation, <i>Aurora</i> (2020), featuring reworked acoustic versions of past songs along with one original new song.
</p><p>Despite significant lineup changes, the band's musical style and lyrical content have remained consistent, with Burnley serving as the primary composer and lead vocalist since the band's inception. The band has commonly been noted for its formulaic hard rock tendencies with angst-heavy lyrics, swelling choruses, and ""crunching"" guitars. In the United States alone, the band has sold more than 19 million units and yielded three RIAA-certified platinum records, two gold records, and several certified singles, including three multi-platinum, three platinum, and six gold. The band has also produced one number one record on the <i>Billboard</i> 200.

</p>
<p><b>The Velvet Underground</b> was an American rock band formed in New York City in 1964. The original line-up consisted of singer/guitarist Lou Reed, multi-instrumentalist John Cale, guitarist Sterling Morrison, and drummer Angus MacLise. MacLise was replaced by Moe Tucker in 1965, who played on most of the band's recordings. Their integration of rock and the avant-garde achieved little commercial success during the group's existence, but they are now recognized as one of the most influential bands in rock, underground, experimental, and alternative music. The group's provocative subject matter, musical experiments, and often nihilistic attitudes also proved influential in the development of punk rock and new wave music.</p><p>The group performed under several names before settling on the Velvet Underground in 1965, inspired by the book of the same name. In 1966, pop artist Andy Warhol became their manager, and they served as the house band at Warhol's studio, the Factory, and his traveling multimedia show, the <i>Exploding Plastic Inevitable</i>, from 1966 to 1967. Their debut album, <i>The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico</i> (with German singer and model Nico), was released in 1967 to critical indifference and poor sales but has since drawn wide acclaim. They released three more albums, <i>White Light/White Heat</i> (1968), <i>The Velvet Underground</i> (1969), and <i>Loaded</i> (1970), with Doug Yule replacing Cale for the final two, and with none performing up to the expectations of record labels or of Reed, the band's leader.
</p><p>The group functionally disbanded in the early 1970s as everyone except Yule left the band.  An abortive UK tour with Yule as the band leader and with new musicians followed in 1973, and a final album released in the band's name, <i>Squeeze</i> (1973), consisting mostly of Yule with a few session musicians, marked the end of the band for some time.  All of the members continued to collaborate on each other's solo work throughout the 1970s and 1980s, and a retrospective ""rarities"" album, <i>VU</i>, was released in 1985.  A full reunion of the band came in the early 1990s, with the Reed–Cale–Tucker–Morrison lineup playing a series of well-received shows in 1993, and releasing a live album from the tour, <i>Live MCMXCIII</i>.
</p><p>After Morrison's death in 1995, the remaining three members played together for a single performance at their Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction in 1996, the last time the band performed together musically. In 2004, the Velvet Underground were ranked number 19 on <i>Rolling Stone</i><span>'</span>s list of the ""100 Greatest Artists of All Time"". <i>The New York Times</i>  wrote that the Velvet Underground was ""arguably the most influential American rock band of our time"".</p>",New York City

</p>
<p><b>Joy Division</b> were  an English rock band formed in Salford in 1976. The group consisted of vocalist Ian Curtis, guitarist/keyboardist Bernard Sumner, bassist Peter Hook and drummer Stephen Morris.
</p><p>Sumner and Hook formed the band after attending a June 1976 Sex Pistols concert. While Joy Division's first recordings were heavily influenced by early punk, they soon developed a sparse, melancholy style that made them one of the pioneers of the post-punk movement. Their self-released 1978 debut EP <i>An Ideal for Living</i> drew the attention of the Manchester television personality Tony Wilson, who signed them to his independent label Factory Records. Their debut album <i>Unknown Pleasures</i>, recorded with producer Martin Hannett, was released in 1979.
</p><p>Frontman Curtis struggled with personal problems including a failing marriage, depression, and epilepsy. As the band's popularity grew, Curtis's health condition made it increasingly difficult for him to perform; he occasionally experienced seizures on stage. He died by suicide on the eve of what would have been the band's first North American tour in May 1980, aged 23. Joy Division's second and final album, <i>Closer</i>, was released two months later; it and the single ""Love Will Tear Us Apart"" became their highest-charting releases.
</p><p>Between July and October 1980 the remaining members regrouped under the name New Order. They were successful throughout the next decade, blending post-punk with electronic and dance music influences. In 2023, both Joy Division and New Order were nominated as one act for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.</p>",Salford

<p><b>Kylie Ann Minogue</b>  (<span></span>; born 28 May 1968) is an Australian singer, songwriter and actress. She is the highest-selling female Australian artist of all time, having sold over 80 million records worldwide. She has been recognised for reinventing herself in music and fashion, for which she is referred to by the European press as the ""Princess of Pop"" and a style icon. Her accolades include a Grammy Award, three Brit Awards and 17 ARIA Music Awards.
</p><p>Born and raised in Melbourne, Minogue first achieved recognition starring in the Australian soap opera <i>Neighbours</i>, playing tomboy mechanic Charlene Robinson. She gained prominence as a recording artist in the late 1980s and released four bubblegum and dance-pop-influenced studio albums produced by Stock Aitken Waterman. By the early 1990s, she had amassed several top ten singles in the UK and Australia, including ""I Should Be So Lucky"", ""The Loco-Motion"", ""Hand on Your Heart"", and ""Better the Devil You Know"". Taking more creative control over her music, Minogue signed with Deconstruction Records in 1993 and released <i>Kylie Minogue</i> (1994) and <i>Impossible Princess</i> (1997), both of which received positive reviews. She returned to mainstream dance-oriented music with 2000's <i>Light Years</i>, including the number-one hits ""Spinning Around"" and ""On a Night Like This"". The follow-up, <i>Fever</i> (2001), was an international breakthrough for Minogue, becoming her best-selling album to date. Two of its singles, ""Love at First Sight"" and ""In Your Eyes"", became hits, but its lead single, ""Can't Get You Out of My Head"" became one of the most successful singles of the 2000s, selling over five million units.
</p><p>Minogue continued reinventing her image and experimenting with a range of genres on her subsequent albums, which spawned successful singles such as ""Slow"", ""2 Hearts"", ""All the Lovers"", ""Santa Baby"", ""Timebomb"" and ""Dancing"". With her 2020 album <i>Disco</i>, she became the first female artist to have a chart-topping album in the UK for five consecutive decades. Minogue made her film debut in <i>The Delinquents</i> (1989) and portrayed Cammy in <i>Street Fighter</i> (1994). She has also appeared in the films <i>Moulin Rouge!</i> (2001), <i>Jack &amp; Diane</i>, <i>Holy Motors</i> (2012) and <i>San Andreas</i> (2015). In 2014, she appeared as a judge on the third series of <i>The Voice UK</i> and <i>The Voice Australia</i>. Her other ventures include product endorsements, children's books, fashion, and charitable work.
</p><p>Minogue was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 2008 New Year Honours for services to music. She was appointed by the French government as a Chevalier (knight) of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres for her contribution to the enrichment of French culture. In 2005, while Minogue was on tour, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. She was awarded an honorary Doctor of Health Science (D.H.Sc.) degree by Anglia Ruskin University in 2011 for her work in raising awareness for breast cancer. At the 2011 ARIA Music Awards, she was inducted by the Australian Recording Industry Association into the ARIA Hall of Fame.

</p>
<p><b>Alice in Chains</b> (often abbreviated as <b>AIC</b>), is an American rock band from Seattle, Washington, formed in 1987 by guitarist and vocalist Jerry Cantrell and drummer Sean Kinney, who later recruited bassist Mike Starr and lead vocalist Layne Staley. Starr was replaced by Mike Inez in 1993. William DuVall joined the band in 2006 as co-lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist, replacing Staley, who had died in 2002. The band took its name from Staley's previous group, the glam metal band Alice N' Chains.</p><p>Often associated with grunge music, Alice in Chains' sound incorporates heavy metal elements. The band is known for its distinctive vocal style, which often included the harmonized vocals between Staley and Cantrell (and later Cantrell and DuVall). Cantrell started to sing lead vocals on the 1992 acoustic EP <i>Sap</i>, and his role continued to grow in the following albums, making Alice in Chains a two-vocal band.</p><p>Alice in Chains rose to international fame as part of the grunge movement of the early 1990s, along with other Seattle bands such as Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Soundgarden. They achieved success during the era with the albums <i>Facelift</i> (1990), <i>Dirt</i> (1992) and <i>Alice in Chains</i> (1995), as well as the EP <i>Jar of Flies</i> (1994). Although never officially disbanding, Alice in Chains was plagued by extended inactivity from 1996 onward, due to Staley's substance abuse, which resulted in his death in 2002. The band regrouped in 2006, with DuVall taking over as lead vocalist full-time, and they have since released three more albums: <i>Black Gives Way to Blue</i> (2009), <i>The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here</i> (2013), and <i>Rainier Fog</i> (2018).
</p><p>Alice in Chains have sold over 40 million records worldwide, and over 19 million records in the US alone. The band has had 18 Top 10 songs on <i>Billboard</i>'s Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, 5 No. 1 hits, and received 11 Grammy Award nominations. The band was ranked number 34 on VH1's <i>100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock</i> and was ranked as the 15th greatest live band by <i>Hit Parader</i>. Since its formation, Alice in Chains has released six studio albums, three EPs, three live albums, four compilations, two DVDs, 43 music videos, and 32 singles.

<p><b>Marvin Pentz Gay Jr.</b>, who also spelled his surname as <b>Gaye</b> (April 2, 1939 – April 1, 1984), was an American R&amp;B and soul singer. He helped to shape the sound of Motown in the 1960s, first as an in-house session player and later as a solo artist with a string of successes, earning him the nicknames ""Prince of Motown"" and ""Prince of Soul"".
</p><p>Gaye's Motown songs include ""Ain't That Peculiar"", ""How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You)"", and ""I Heard It Through the Grapevine"". Gaye also recorded duets with Mary Wells, Kim Weston, Tammi Terrell, and Diana Ross. During the 1970s, Gaye recorded the albums <i>What's Going On</i> and <i>Let's Get It On</i> and became one of the first artists in Motown to break away from the reins of a production company.
</p><p>His later recordings influenced several contemporary R&amp;B subgenres, such as quiet storm and neo soul. ""Sexual Healing"", released in 1982 on the album <i>Midnight Love</i>, won him his first two Grammy Awards. Gaye's last televised appearances were at the 1983 NBA All-Star Game, where he sang ""The Star-Spangled Banner""; <i>Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever</i>; and <i>Soul Train</i>.</p><p>On April 1, 1984, the eve of his 45th birthday, Gaye was shot and killed by his father, Marvin Gay Sr., at their house in Hancock Park, Los Angeles, after an argument. Gay Sr. later pleaded no contest to voluntary manslaughter, and received a six-year suspended sentence and five years of probation. Many institutions have posthumously bestowed Gaye with awards and other honors including the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, and inductions into the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame, the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.</p>",

</p>
<p><b>Soundgarden</b> was an American rock band formed in Seattle, Washington, in 1984 by singer and drummer Chris Cornell, lead guitarist Kim Thayil (both of whom are the only members to appear in every incarnation of the band), and bassist Hiro Yamamoto; Cornell switched to rhythm guitar in 1985, replaced on drums initially by Scott Sundquist, and later by Matt Cameron in 1986. Yamamoto left in 1990 and was replaced initially by Jason Everman and shortly thereafter by Ben Shepherd. The band dissolved in 1997 and re-formed in 2010. Following Cornell's death in 2017 and a year of uncertainty regarding the band's future, Thayil declared in October 2018 that Soundgarden had disbanded once again, though they did reunite in January 2019 for a one-off concert in tribute to Cornell.</p><p>The band helped to popularize grunge music, a style of alternative rock that developed in the American Pacific Northwest in the mid-1980s, alongside such Seattle contemporaries as Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, and Nirvana. They were the first of a number of grunge bands to sign to the Seattle-based record label Sub Pop, through which they released EPs in both 1987 and 1988. California-based independent label SST Records released Soundgarden's debut album, <i>Ultramega OK</i>, which, although it did not sell well nationally, garnered critical acclaim and was nominated for a Grammy award in 1990. Their second album, <i>Louder Than Love</i>, was recorded independently, but, after they signed with A&amp;M Records in 1989 (making them one of the first grunge bands to sign to a major label), the album became their major-label debut. While <i>Ultramega OK</i> had failed to chart and <i>Louder Than Love</i> peaked at number 108 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 album chart, the band's third album, <i>Badmotorfinger</i>, buoyed by the success of the singles ""Jesus Christ Pose"", ""Outshined"", and ""Rusty Cage"", reached number 39 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 and has been certified double-platinum by the RIAA.
</p><p>Soundgarden achieved its biggest success with the 1994 album <i>Superunknown</i>, which debuted at number one on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 and yielded the Grammy Award-winning singles ""Spoonman"" and ""Black Hole Sun"". The band experimented with new sonic textures on their follow-up album <i>Down on the Upside</i>, which debuted at number 2 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 in 1996 and spawned several hit singles of its own, including ""Burden in My Hand"" and ""Blow Up the Outside World"". In 1997, the band broke up due to internal strife over its creative direction and exhaustion from touring. After more than a decade of working on projects and other bands, they reunited in 2010, and Republic Records released their sixth and final studio album, <i>King Animal</i>, two years later.
</p><p>As of 2019, Soundgarden had sold more than 14 million records in the United States, and an estimated 30 million worldwide. VH1 ranked Soundgarden at number 14 in their special <i>100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock</i>.</p>

<p><b>Peter Gene Hernandez</b> (born October 8, 1985), known professionally as <b>Bruno Mars</b>, is an American singer, songwriter, and record producer. He is known for his stage performances, retro showmanship, and for performing in a wide range of musical styles, including pop, R&amp;B, funk, soul, reggae, disco, and rock. Mars is accompanied by his band, the Hooligans, who play a variety of instruments, such as electric guitar, bass, piano, keyboards, drums, and horns, and also serve as backup singers and dancers.
</p><p>Born and raised in Honolulu, Hawaii, Mars moved to Los Angeles in 2003 to pursue a musical career. In 2009, he co-founded the production team The Smeezingtons, responsible for various successful singles for Mars himself and other artists. He rose to fame in 2010 buoyed by the success of ""Nothin' on You"" by B.o.B and ""Billionaire"" by Travie McCoy, both of which featured his vocals. That year, Mars released his debut studio album <i>Doo-Wops &amp; Hooligans</i>, which blended pop with reggae and R&amp;B. It spawned the international number-one singles ""Just the Way You Are"", ""Grenade"", and ""The Lazy Song"". Drawing inspiration from disco, funk, rock, reggae and soul genres, his second studio album, <i>Unorthodox Jukebox</i> (2012), was his first number one on the <i>Billboard</i> 200. It amassed two <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 number-one songs, ""Locked Out of Heaven"" and ""When I Was Your Man"".
</p><p>In 2014, Mars was featured on Mark Ronson's ""Uptown Funk"", which topped various music charts, spending a total of fourteen and seven weeks atop the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart, respectively. Mars's third studio album, the R&amp;B-focused <i>24K Magic</i> (2016), received seven Grammy Awards, winning the major categories of Album of the Year, Record of the Year, and Song of the Year. The album also yielded the top-five singles ""24K Magic"", ""That's What I Like"" (his seventh <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 number-one single), and a remix of ""Finesse"" featuring Cardi B. In 2021, Mars and Anderson .Paak, as Silk Sonic, released the collaborative studio album <i>An Evening with Silk Sonic</i>, which delved into 1970s R&amp;B and soul and was led by the chart-topping single ""Leave the Door Open"". It received four Grammy Awards, including Record of the Year and Song of the Year.
</p><p>Mars has sold over 130 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time. Eight of his songs have reached number one on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 and his concert tours are some of the highest-grossing in history. He has received 15 Grammy Awards (including three  Record of the Year wins), four Brit Awards, eleven American Music Awards, 13 Soul Train Awards and holds three <i>Guinness World Records</i>, among other accolades. He featured on <i>Music Week</i><span>'</span>s best songwriters (2011) and <i>Billboard</i><span>'</span>s Greatest of All Time Artists (2019) lists and rankings such as the <i>Time</i> 100 and <i>Forbes</i> Celebrity 100. Mars became the first artist to receive six Diamond-certified songs in the United States and has been regarded as a pop icon due to his influential career.

</p>
<p><b>Ludwig van Beethoven</b> (baptised 17 December 1770 – 26 March 1827) was a German composer and pianist. Beethoven remains one of the most admired composers in the history of Western music; his works rank amongst the most performed of the classical music repertoire and span the transition from the Classical period to the Romantic era in classical music. His career has conventionally been divided into early, middle, and late periods. His early period, during which he forged his craft, is typically considered to have lasted until 1802. From 1802 to around 1812, his middle period showed an individual development from the styles of Joseph Haydn and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and is sometimes characterized as heroic. During this time, he began to grow increasingly deaf. In his late period, from 1812 to 1827, he extended his innovations in musical form and expression.
</p><p>Beethoven was born in Bonn. His musical talent was obvious at an early age. He was initially harshly and intensively taught by his father Johann van Beethoven. Beethoven was later taught by the composer and conductor Christian Gottlob Neefe, under whose tutelage he published his first work, a set of keyboard variations, in 1783. He found relief from a dysfunctional home life with the family of Helene von Breuning, whose children he loved, befriended, and taught piano. At age 21, he moved to Vienna, which subsequently became his base, and studied composition with Haydn. Beethoven then gained a reputation as a virtuoso pianist, and he was soon patronized by Karl Alois, Prince Lichnowsky for compositions, which resulted in his three Opus 1 piano trios (the earliest works to which he accorded an opus number) in 1795.
</p><p>His first major orchestral work, the First Symphony, premiered in 1800, and his first set of string quartets was published in 1801. Despite his hearing deteriorating during this period, he continued to conduct, premiering his Third and Fifth Symphonies in 1804 and 1808, respectively. His Violin Concerto appeared in 1806. His last piano concerto (No. 5, Op. 73, known as the <i>Emperor</i>), dedicated to his frequent patron Archduke Rudolf of Austria, was premiered in 1811, without Beethoven as soloist. He was almost completely deaf by 1814, and he then gave up performing and appearing in public. He described his problems with health and his unfulfilled personal life in two letters, his Heiligenstadt Testament (1802) to his brothers and his unsent love letter to an unknown ""Immortal Beloved"" (1812).
</p><p>After 1810, increasingly less socially involved, Beethoven composed many of his most admired works, including later symphonies, mature chamber music and the late piano sonatas. His only opera, <i>Fidelio</i>, first performed in 1805, was revised to its final version in 1814. He composed <i>Missa solemnis</i> between 1819 and 1823 and his final Symphony, No. 9, one of the first examples of a choral symphony, between 1822 and 1824. Written in his last years, his late string quartets, including the <i>Grosse Fuge</i>, of 1825–1826 are among his final achievements. After some months of bedridden illness, he died in 1827. Beethoven's works remain mainstays of the classical music repertoire.

</p>
<p><b>Philip David Charles Collins</b>  (born 30 January 1951) is an English singer, musician, songwriter, record producer and actor. He was the drummer and later lead singer of the rock band Genesis and also has a career as a solo performer. Between 1982 and 1990, Collins achieved three UK and seven US number one singles as a solo artist. When his work with Genesis, his work with other artists, as well as his solo career is totalled, he had more US top 40 singles than any other artist during the 1980s. His most successful singles from the period include ""In the Air Tonight"", ""Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)"", ""One More Night"", and ""Another Day in Paradise"".
</p><p>Born and raised in west London, Collins played drums from the age of five and completed drama school training, which secured him various roles as a child actor, with his first major role, aged 13, as the Artful Dodger in the West End musical <i>Oliver!</i>. He then pursued a music career, joining Genesis in 1970 as their drummer and becoming lead singer in 1975 following the departure of Peter Gabriel. Collins began a successful solo career in the 1980s, initially inspired by his marital breakdown and love of soul music, releasing the albums <i>Face Value</i> (1981), <i>Hello, I Must Be Going</i> (1982), <i>No Jacket Required</i> (1985) and <i>...But Seriously</i> (1989). Collins became, in the words of AllMusic, ""one of the most successful pop and adult contemporary singers of the '80s and beyond"". He also became known for a distinctive gated reverb drum sound on many of his recordings. In 1985, he was the only artist to perform at both Live Aid concerts. He also resumed his acting career, appearing in <i>Miami Vice</i> and subsequently starring in the film <i>Buster</i> (1988). In 1996, Collins left Genesis to focus on solo work; this included writing songs for Disney's <i>Tarzan</i> (1999) for which he received an Oscar for Best Original Song for ""You'll Be in My Heart"". He rejoined Genesis for their Turn It On Again Tour in 2007. Following a five-year retirement to focus on his family life, Collins released an autobiography in 2016 and completed his Not Dead Yet Tour in 2019. He then rejoined Genesis in 2020 for a second reunion tour, ending in March 2022.
</p><p>Collins's discography includes eight studio albums that have sold 33.5 million certified units in the US and an estimated 150 million records sold worldwide, making him one of the world's best-selling artists. He is one of only three recording artists, along with Paul McCartney and Michael Jackson, who have sold over 100 million records both as solo artists and separately as principal members of a band. He has won eight Grammy Awards, six Brit Awards (winning Best British Male Artist three times), two Golden Globe Awards, one Academy Award, and a Disney Legend Award. He was awarded six Ivor Novello Awards from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors, including the International Achievement Award. He received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1999, and was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2003 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Genesis in 2010. He has also been recognised by music publications with induction into the <i>Modern Drummer</i> Hall of Fame in 2012, and the <i>Classic Drummer</i> Hall of Fame in 2013.</p>",

</p>
<p><b>Ramones</b> were an American punk rock band that formed in the New York City neighborhood of Forest Hills, Queens, in 1974. They are often cited as the first true punk rock group. Despite achieving a limited commercial appeal in the United States during their time together, the band saw more success in England, Argentina and Brazil, and are today seen as highly influential.
</p><p>All of the band members adopted pseudonyms ending with the surname ""Ramone"", although none of them were biologically related; they were inspired by Paul McCartney, who would check into hotels as ""Paul Ramon"". The Ramones performed 2,263 concerts, touring virtually nonstop for 22 years. In 1996, after a tour with the Lollapalooza music festival, they played a farewell concert in Los Angeles and disbanded. By 2014, all four of the band's original members had died – lead singer Joey Ramone (1951–2001), bassist Dee Dee Ramone (1951–2002), guitarist Johnny Ramone (1948–2004) and drummer Tommy Ramone (1949–2014). The remaining surviving members of the Ramones—bassist C. J. Ramone (who replaced Dee Dee in 1989 and stayed with the band until its dissolution) and drummers Marky Ramone, Richie Ramone and Elvis Ramone—are still musically active.
</p><p>Recognition of the band's importance built over the years. The Ramones ranked number 26 in <i>Rolling Stone</i> magazine's list of the ""100 Greatest Artists of All Time"" and number 17 in VH1's ""100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock"". In 2002, the Ramones were ranked the second-greatest band of all time by <i>Spin</i>, trailing only the Beatles. On March 18, 2002, the original four members and Tommy's replacement on drums, Marky Ramone, were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in their first year of eligibility. In 2011, the group was awarded a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.</p>

</p>
<p><b>New Order</b> are  an English rock band formed in 1980 by vocalist and guitarist Bernard Sumner, bassist Peter Hook and drummer Stephen Morris. The members regrouped after the disbandment of their previous band Joy Division due to the suicide of lead singer Ian Curtis. They were joined by Gillian Gilbert on keyboards later that year. New Order's integration of post-punk with electronic and dance music made them one of the most acclaimed and influential bands of the 1980s. They were the flagship band for Manchester-based independent record label Factory Records and its nightclub The Haçienda, and they worked in long-term collaboration with graphic designer Peter Saville.</p><p>While the band's early years were overshadowed by the legacy of Joy Division, their experience of the early 1980s New York club scene saw them increasingly incorporate dance rhythms and electronic instrumentation into their work. Their 1983 hit ""Blue Monday"" became the best-selling 12-inch single of all time and a popular club track. In the 1980s, they released successful albums such as <i>Power, Corruption &amp; Lies</i> (1983), <i>Technique</i> (1989), and the singles compilation <i>Substance</i> (1987). They disbanded in 1993 to work on individual projects before reuniting in 1998. In the years since then New Order has gone through various hiatuses and personnel changes, most prominently the departure of Hook in 2007 due to personal disputes with the other members.  In 2015 they released their tenth studio album, <i>Music Complete</i>.  In 2023, both Joy Division and New Order were nominated as one act for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.</p>",Salford

<p><b>Rammstein</b> (<small>German pronunciation: </small><span title=""Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)"" lang=""de-Latn-fonipa"">[ˈʁamʃtaɪn]</span>, <abbr style=""font-size:85%"" title=""literal translation"">lit.</abbr> ""ramming stone"") is a German Neue Deutsche Härte band formed in Berlin in 1994. The band's lineup—consisting of lead vocalist Till Lindemann, lead guitarist Richard Kruspe, rhythm guitarist Paul Landers, bassist Oliver Riedel, drummer Christoph Schneider, and keyboardist Christian ""Flake"" Lorenz—has remained unchanged throughout their history, along with their approach to songwriting, which consists of Lindemann writing and singing the lyrics over instrumental pieces the rest of the band has completed beforehand. Prior to their formation, some members were associated with the punk rock acts Feeling B and First Arsch.
</p><p>After winning a local contest, Rammstein was able to record demos and send them to different record labels, eventually signing with Motor Music. Working with producer Jacob Hellner, they released their debut album <i>Herzeleid</i> in 1995. Though the album initially sold poorly, the band gained popularity through their live performances and the album eventually reached No. 6 in Germany. Their second album, <i>Sehnsucht</i>, was released in 1997 and debuted at No. 1 in Germany, resulting in a worldwide tour lasting nearly four years and spawning the successful singles ""Engel"" and ""Du hast"" and the live album <i>Live aus Berlin</i> (1999). Following the tour, Rammstein signed with major label Universal Music and released <i>Mutter</i> in 2001. Six singles were released from the album, all charting in countries throughout Europe. The lead single, ""Sonne"", reached No. 2 in Germany. Rammstein released <i>Reise, Reise</i> in 2004 and had two more singles reach No. 2 in Germany: ""Mein Teil"" and ""Amerika""; the former song reached No. 1 in Spain, becoming their first No. 1 single.
</p><p>Their fifth album, <i>Rosenrot</i>, was released in 2005, and the lead single, ""Benzin"", reached No. 6 in Germany. Their second live album, <i>Völkerball</i>, was released in 2006. The band released their sixth album, <i>Liebe ist für alle da</i>, in 2009, with its lead single, ""Pussy"", becoming their first No. 1 hit in Germany despite having a controversial music video that featured hardcore pornography. The band then entered a recording hiatus and toured for several years, releasing the <i>Made in Germany</i> greatest hits album as well as the <i>Rammstein in Amerika</i> and <i>Paris</i> live albums. After a decade without new music, Rammstein returned in 2019 with the song ""Deutschland"", which became their second No. 1 hit in Germany. Their untitled seventh studio album was released in May 2019 and reached No. 1 in 14 countries. While sheltering during COVID-19 lockdowns, the band spontaneously wrote and recorded their eighth studio album, <i>Zeit</i>, which was released in April 2022.
</p><p>Rammstein was one of the first bands to emerge within the Neue Deutsche Härte genre, with their debut album leading the music press to coin the term, and their style of music has generally had a positive reception from music critics. Commercially, the band has been very successful, earning many No. 1 albums as well as gold and platinum certifications in countries around the world. Their grand live performances, which often feature pyrotechnics, have contributed to the growth in their popularity. Despite success, the band has been subject to some controversies, with their overall image having been criticized; for instance, the song ""Ich tu dir weh"" forced its parent album <i>Liebe ist für alle da</i> to be re-released in Germany with the song removed due to its sexually explicit lyrics.

<p><b>Destiny's Child</b> was an American girl group whose final line-up comprised Beyoncé Knowles, Kelly Rowland, and Michelle Williams. The group began their musical career as <b>Girl's Tyme</b>, formed in 1990 in Houston, Texas. After years of limited success, the original quartet comprising Knowles, Rowland, LaTavia Roberson, and LeToya Luckett were signed in 1997 to Columbia Records as Destiny's Child. The group was launched into mainstream recognition following the release of the song ""No, No, No"" and their best-selling second album, <i>The Writing's on the Wall</i> (1999), which contained the number-one singles ""Bills, Bills, Bills"" and ""Say My Name"". Despite critical and commercial success, the group was plagued by internal conflict and legal turmoil, as Roberson and Luckett attempted to split from the group's manager Mathew Knowles, citing favoritism of Knowles and Rowland.
</p><p>In early 2000, both Roberson and Luckett were replaced with Williams and Farrah Franklin; however, Franklin quit after a few months, leaving the group as a trio. Their third album, <i>Survivor</i> (2001), whose themes the public interpreted as a channel to the group's experience, produced the worldwide hits ""Independent Women"", ""Survivor"" and ""Bootylicious"". In 2001, they announced a hiatus to pursue solo careers. The trio reunited two years later for the release of their fifth and final studio album, <i>Destiny Fulfilled</i> (2004), which spawned the international hits ""Lose My Breath"" and ""Soldier"". Since the group's official disbandment in 2006, Knowles, Rowland, and Williams have reunited several times, including at the 2013 Super Bowl halftime show and 2018 Coachella festival.
</p><p>Destiny's Child has sold more than 60 million records as of 2013. <i>Billboard</i> ranks the group as one of the greatest musical trios of all time, the ninth most successful artist/band of the 2000s, placed the group 68th in its All-Time Hot 100 Artists list in 2008 and in December 2016, the magazine ranked them as the 90th most successful dance club artist of all time.

<p><b>Eunice Kathleen Waymon</b> (February 21, 1933 – April 21, 2003), known professionally as <b>Nina Simone</b> (<span></span>), was an American singer, songwriter, pianist, and civil rights activist. Her music spanned styles including classical, folk, gospel, blues, jazz, R&amp;B, and pop.
</p><p>The sixth of eight children born from a poor family in Tryon, North Carolina, Simone initially aspired to be a concert pianist. With the help of a few supporters in her hometown, she enrolled in the Juilliard School of Music in New York City. She then applied for a scholarship to study at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, where, despite a well received audition, she was denied admission, which she attributed to racism. In 2003, just days before her death, the Institute awarded her an honorary degree.</p><p>To make a living, Simone started playing piano at a nightclub in Atlantic City. She changed her name to ""Nina Simone"" to disguise herself from family members, having chosen to play ""the devil's music"" or so-called ""cocktail piano"". She was told in the nightclub that she would have to sing to her own accompaniment, which effectively launched her career as a jazz vocalist. She went on to record more than 40 albums between 1958 and 1974, making her debut with <i>Little Girl Blue</i>. She had a hit single in the United States in 1958 with ""I Loves You, Porgy"". Her musical style fused gospel and pop with classical music, in particular Johann Sebastian Bach, and accompanied expressive, jazz-like singing in her contralto voice.</p>",

</p>
<p><b>Van Halen</b> (<span></span> <i title=""English pronunciation respelling"">van <span>HAY</span>-len</i>) was an American rock band formed in Pasadena, California, in 1972. Credited with ""restoring hard rock to the forefront of the music scene"", Van Halen was known for its energetic live shows and for the virtuosity of its lead guitarist, Eddie Van Halen. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2007.
</p><p>From 1974 until 1985, Van Halen consisted of Eddie Van Halen; Eddie's brother, drummer Alex Van Halen; vocalist David Lee Roth; and bassist/vocalist Michael Anthony. Upon its release in 1978, the band's self-titled debut album reached No. 19 on the <i>Billboard</i> pop music charts and would sell over 10 million copies in the U.S. By 1982, the band released four more albums (<i>Van Halen II</i>, <i>Women and Children First</i>, <i>Fair Warning</i>, and <i>Diver Down</i>), all of which have since been certified multi-platinum. By the early 1980s, Van Halen was one of the most successful rock acts of the day. The album <i>1984</i> was a commercial success with U.S. sales of 10 million copies and four hit singles; its lead single, ""Jump"", was the band's only U.S. number one single.
</p><p>In 1985, Roth left the band to embark on a solo career and was replaced by former Montrose lead vocalist Sammy Hagar. With Hagar, the group released four U.S. number-one, multi-platinum albums over the course of 11 years (<i>5150</i> in 1986, <i>OU812</i> in 1988, <i>For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge</i> in 1991, and <i>Balance</i> in 1995). Hagar left the band in 1996 shortly before the release of the band's first greatest hits collection, <i>Best Of – Volume I</i>. Former Extreme frontman Gary Cherone replaced Hagar and recorded the commercially unsuccessful album <i>Van Halen III</i> with the band in 1998, before parting ways in 1999. Van Halen then went on hiatus until reuniting with Hagar in 2003 for a worldwide tour in 2004 and the double-disc greatest hits collection <i>The Best of Both Worlds</i>. Hagar again left Van Halen in 2005. In 2006 Roth returned, but Anthony was replaced on bass guitar by Eddie's son, Wolfgang Van Halen. In 2012, the band released their final studio album <i>A Different Kind of Truth</i>, which was commercially and critically successful; it was also Van Halen's first album with Roth in 28 years and the only one to feature Wolfgang.
</p><p>As of March 2019, Van Halen is 20th on the RIAA list of best-selling artists in the United States; the band has sold 56 million albums in the States and more than 80 million worldwide, making them one of the best-selling groups of all time. As of 2007, Van Halen is one of only five rock bands with two studio albums to sell more than 10 million copies in the United States and is tied for the most multi-platinum albums by an American band. Additionally, Van Halen has charted 13 number-one hits on <i>Billboard</i><span>'</span>s Mainstream Rock chart. VH1 ranked the band seventh on a list of the top 100 Hard Rock artists of all time.</p><p>Eddie was diagnosed with cancer in 2001, and died of the disease on October 6, 2020. A month after his father's death, Wolfgang confirmed that Van Halen had disbanded.</p>

</p>
<p><b>William Martin Joel</b> (born May 9, 1949) is an American singer, pianist and songwriter. Commonly nicknamed the ""Piano Man"" after his signature song of the same name, he has led a commercially successful career as a solo artist since the 1970s, having released 12 pop and rock studio albums from 1971 to 1993 as well as one studio album of classical compositions in 2001. He is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, as well as the seventh-best-selling recording artist and the fourth-best-selling solo artist in the United States, with over 160 million records sold worldwide. His 1985 compilation album, <i>Greatest Hits Vol. 1 &amp; 2</i>, is one of the best-selling albums in the United States.</p><p>Born in The Bronx, Joel grew up on Long Island, where both places influenced his music. Growing up, he took piano lessons at his mother's insistence. After dropping out of high school to pursue a music career, Joel took part in two short-lived bands, The Hassles and Attila, before signing a record deal with Family Productions and starting off a solo career in 1971 with his first release <i>Cold Spring Harbor</i>. In 1972, Joel caught the attention of Columbia Records after a live radio performance of the song ""Captain Jack"" became popular in Philadelphia, prompting him to sign a new record deal with the company and release his second album, <i>Piano Man</i>, in 1973. After <i>Streetlife Serenade</i> and <i>Turnstiles</i> in 1974 and 1976 respectively, Joel released his critical and commercial breakthrough album, <i>The Stranger</i>, in 1977. This album became Columbia's bestselling release, selling over 10 million copies and spawning several hit singles, including ""Just the Way You Are"", ""Movin' Out (Anthony's Song)"", ""Only the Good Die Young"", and ""She's Always a Woman""; the album also contains the popular album tracks ""Scenes from an Italian Restaurant"", Joel's favorite of his own songs which has become a firm staple of his live shows, and ""Vienna"", also one of Joel's personal favorites and nowadays one of his most streamed songs on the internet.</p><p>Joel's next album, <i>52nd Street</i>, was released in 1978 and it soon became his first album to peak at No.1 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 chart. Joel released his seventh studio album, <i>Glass Houses</i>, in 1980 in an attempt to further establish himself as a rock artist; this release featured ""It's Still Rock and Roll to Me"" (Joel's first single to top the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 chart), ""You May Be Right"", ""Don't Ask Me Why"", and ""Sometimes a Fantasy"". His next album, <i>The Nylon Curtain</i>, was released in 1982, and stemmed from a desire to create more lyrically and melodically ambitious music. <i>An Innocent Man</i>, released in 1983, served as a homage to genres of music which Joel had grown up with in the 1950s, such as rhythm and blues and doo-wop; this release featured ""Tell Her About It"", ""Uptown Girl"" and ""The Longest Time"", three of his best-known songs. After <i>The Bridge</i> and <i>Storm Front</i> in 1986 and 1989 respectively, Joel released his twelfth studio album, <i>River of Dreams</i>, in 1993. He went on to release <i>Fantasies and Delusions</i>, a 2001 album featuring classical compositions composed by Joel and performed by British-Korean pianist Richard Hyung-ki Joo. Joel provided voiceover work in 1988 for the Disney animated film <i>Oliver &amp; Company</i>, in which he played the character Dodger with his song, ""Why Should I Worry?"", and contributed to the soundtracks to several different films, including <i>Easy Money</i>, <i>Ruthless People</i>, and <i>Honeymoon in Vegas</i>.
</p><p>Across the 20 years of his solo career, Joel produced 33 self-penned Top 40 hits in the U.S., three of which (""It's Still Rock and Roll to Me"", ""Tell Her About It"", and ""We Didn't Start the Fire"") reached the top of the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 charts. Joel has been nominated for 23 Grammy Awards, winning 6 of them, including Album of the Year for <i>52nd Street</i>. Joel was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame (1992), the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (1999), and the Long Island Music Hall of Fame (2006). In 2001, Joel received the Johnny Mercer Award from the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In 2013, Joel received the Kennedy Center Honors for influencing American culture through the arts. Since the advent of his solo career, Joel has had a successful touring career, holding live performances across the globe. In 1987, he became one of the first artists to hold a rock tour in the Soviet Union following the country's alleviation of the ban on rock music. Though he has not released a pop rock album since <i>River of Dreams</i>, he continues to tour; he frequently performs at Madison Square Garden.

<p><b>Bryan Guy Adams</b>  <span>FRPS</span> (born  November 5, 1959) is a Canadian singer, songwriter, guitarist, composer, and photographer. He has been cited as one of the best-selling music artists of all time, and is estimated to have sold between 75 million and more than 100 million records and singles worldwide. Adams was the most played artist on Canadian radio in the 2010s and has had 25 top-15 singles in Canada and a dozen or more in each of the US, UK, and Australia.
</p><p>Adams joined his first band at age 15, and at age 20 his eponymous debut album was released. He rose to fame in North America with the 1983 top ten album <i>Cuts Like a Knife</i>, featuring its title track and the ballad ""Straight From the Heart"", his first US top ten hit. His 1984 Canadian and US number one album, <i>Reckless</i> (which became the first album by a Canadian to be certified diamond in Canada), made him a global star with tracks like ""Run to You"" and ""Summer of '69"", both top ten hits in the US and Canada, and the power ballad ""Heaven"", a US number one hit. His 1987 album <i>Into the Fire</i>, with its US and Canadian top ten song, ""Heat of the Night"", rose to number two in Canada and the top ten in the US and several other countries. In 1989, he ended the decade by co writing with fellow Canadian songwriter Jim Vallance and American songwriter Diane Warren ""When the Night Comes"", played at the end credits of that year's Tom Selleck starred crime drama, <i>An Innocent Man</i>.
</p><p>In 1991, Adams released ""(Everything I Do) I Do It for You"", which went to number one in at least 19 countries, including for 16 and 18 straight weeks in the UK, and Europe overall, both records. It is one of the best-selling singles of all time, having sold more than 15 million copies worldwide. The song was included on Adams' <i>Waking Up the Neighbours</i> (1991), a worldwide number one album that sold 16 million copies, including being certified diamond in Canada. Another major hit off the album was the Canadian number one and US number two hit ""Can't Stop This Thing We Started"", which also went top ten in several other countries. Beginning in 1993, Adams' hits were mostly ballads, including the worldwide number one or two hits ""Please Forgive Me"" (1993); ""All for Love"" (1993); and ""Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman?"" (1995), the latter two topping the U.S. <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. Adam's 1993 greatest hits compilation album, <i>So Far So Good</i>, topped the charts in numerous countries selling 13 million copies worldwide, including being certified 6× platinum in Canada, 5× platinum in the US, and 14× platinum in Australia.
</p><p>In 1996, Adams' <i>18 til I Die</i> was a top five album in many countries, but only reached number 31 in the US. He did duets with Barbra Streisand (""I Finally Found Someone"" (1996), his last US top ten hit) and Melanie C (""When You're Gone"" (1998), an international top five hit). In the 1990s, Adams had six European Radio Airplay number one songs for 32 weeks, the fourth and third most, respectively; and three number one songs on the European Sales Chart for 29 weeks total, the most weeks of any artist.

</p>
<p><b>Deftones</b> is an American alternative metal band formed in Sacramento, California in 1988. They were formed by Chino Moreno (vocals, guitar), Stephen Carpenter (guitar), Abe Cunningham (drums), and Dominic Garcia (bass). During their first five years, the band's lineup changed several times, but stabilized in 1993 when Cunningham rejoined after his departure in 1990; by this time, Chi Cheng was bassist. The lineup remained stable for fifteen years, with the exception of keyboardist and turntablist Frank Delgado being added in 1999. The band’s experimental nature has led some critics to describe them as ""the Radiohead of metal"".</p><p>Deftones have released nine albums since their inception. After the lineup settled in 1993, the band secured a recording contract with Maverick Records, and subsequently released their debut album <i>Adrenaline</i> in 1995. Promoting the album by touring exhaustively with other bands in the scene, Deftones managed to gain a dedicated fan base through word of mouth. Their second album <i>Around the Fur</i> was released in 1997, reached chart positions along with its singles, and became the band's first to receive certification from the RIAA. The band found even further success with their third album <i>White Pony</i> (2000), which saw a transition away from their earlier, more aggressive sound into a more experimental direction. Its lead single ""Change (In the House of Flies)"" is the band's most commercially successful single, and the track ""Elite"" won a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance; it was also the band's first of three albums to be certified platinum in the United States. Their self-titled fourth album was released in 2003. While the group's critical success continued, sales proved to be lackluster compared to <i>White Pony</i>.
</p><p>Deftones' fifth studio effort, <i>Saturday Night Wrist</i>, was released in 2006. While critically acclaimed, the album’s production was marred by creative tensions and personal issues within the band, some of which influenced its material. In 2008, while Deftones were working on an album tentatively titled <i>Eros</i>, Cheng was involved in a traffic collision. As a result, he was left in a minimally conscious state until his death in 2013 of cardiac arrest. After Cheng's accident, Deftones halted production on <i>Eros</i>. Quicksand bassist Sergio Vega, who had filled in as a touring member to replace Cheng, later became his permanent replacement, though Vega alleges he was never an official member.
</p><p>The band released the critically celebrated <i>Diamond Eyes</i> in 2010 and embarked on a triple-headline tour with Alice in Chains and Mastodon throughout North America. Their seventh and eighth albums, <i>Koi No Yokan</i> (2012) and  <i>Gore</i> (2016) respectively, saw the band continue to move in an increasingly experimental direction and were released to critical acclaim. Their latest album, <i>Ohms</i>, was released on September 25, 2020, receiving significant critical praise for its return to the band's heavier sound. In March 2022, it was announced that bassist Sergio Vega had left the band in early 2021. They have sold more than 10 million albums worldwide.</p>",Sacramento

He received numerous accolades including the Grammy Award for Best Male Vocal Performance for <i>Hello, Dolly!</i> in 1965, as well as a posthumous win for the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1972, and the induction into the National Rhythm &amp; Blues Hall of Fame in 2017.</p><p>Armstrong was born and raised in New Orleans. Coming to prominence in the 1920s as an inventive trumpet and cornet player, Armstrong was a foundational influence in jazz, shifting the focus of the music from collective improvisation to solo performance. Around 1922, he followed his mentor, Joe ""King"" Oliver, to Chicago to play in the Creole Jazz Band. He earned a reputation at ""cutting contests"", and his fame reached band leader Fletcher Henderson. He moved to New York City, where he became a featured and musically influential band soloist and recording artist. By the 1950s, he was a national musical icon, assisted in part, by his appearances on radio and in film and television, in addition to his concerts.
</p><p>His best known songs include ""What a Wonderful World"", ""La Vie en Rose"", ""Hello, Dolly!"", ""On the Sunny Side of the Street"", ""Dream a Little Dream of Me"", ""When You're Smiling"" and ""When the Saints Go Marching In"". He collaborated with Ella Fitzgerald producing three records together <i>Ella and Louis</i> (1956), <i>Ella and Louis Again</i> (1957), and <i>Porgy and Bess</i> (1959). He also appeared in films such as <i>A Rhapsody in Black and Blue</i> (1932), <i>Cabin in the Sky</i> (1943), <i>High Society</i> (1956), <i>Paris Blues</i> (1961), <i>A Man Called Adam</i> (1966), and <i>Hello, Dolly!</i> (1969).
</p><p>With his instantly recognizable rich, gravelly voice, Armstrong was also an influential singer and skillful improviser, bending the lyrics and melody of a song. He was also skilled at scat singing. By the end of Armstrong's life, his influence had spread to popular music in general. Armstrong was one of the first popular African-American entertainers to ""cross over"" to wide popularity with white (and international) audiences. He rarely publicly politicized his race, to the dismay of fellow African Americans, but took a well-publicized stand for desegregation in the Little Rock crisis. He was able to access the upper echelons of American society at a time when this was difficult for black men.

<p>A <b>prince</b> is a male ruler (ranked below a king, grand prince, and grand duke) or a male member of a monarch's or former monarch's family. <i>Prince</i> is also a title of nobility (often highest), often hereditary, in some European states. The female equivalent is a princess. The English word derives, via the French word <i>prince</i>, from the Latin noun <span title=""Latin-language text""><i lang=""la"">prīnceps</i></span>, from <span title=""Latin-language text""><i lang=""la"">primus</i></span> (first) and <span title=""Latin-language text""><i lang=""la"">caput</i></span> (head), meaning ""the first, foremost, the chief, most distinguished, noble ruler, prince"".</p>

</p>
<p><b>Tenacious D</b> is an American comedy rock duo formed in Los Angeles, California in 1994. It was founded by actors Jack Black and Kyle Gass, who were members of The Actors' Gang theater company at the time. The duo's name is derived from ""tenacious defense"", a phrase used by NBA basketball sportscasters Walt Frazier and Marv Albert.</p><p>Prior to the release of Tenacious D's 2001 debut album <i>Tenacious D</i>, the duo had a three-episode TV series released on HBO, with the episodes broadcasting between 1997 and 2000. This series came about after the band had met David Cross on the Los Angeles music scene—and Black featuring in episodes of <i>Mr. Show with Bob and David</i>. The band also befriended former Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl, which began a working relationship between Foo Fighters and Tenacious D. Towards the end of the 1990s, the duo supported large rock acts such as Weezer, Pearl Jam, Tool, and Beck.</p><p>In 2000, they signed with Epic Records and the year after released <i>Tenacious D,</i> their debut album featuring a full band, including Grohl on the drums. Their first single, ""Tribute"", has achieved cult status since its release, contributing to their popularity in the United Kingdom, Sweden, Ireland and Australia. In 2003, the band released <i>The Complete Master Works</i>, their first live concert DVD which achieved gold and platinum status by the RIAA.</p><p>In November 2006, they starred in their own film, <i>Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny,</i> released by New Line Cinema, with Epic Records releasing the soundtrack as their second album, <i>The Pick of Destiny.</i> The film cost $20 million to produce, though only grossed $13.9 million at the box office and suffered mixed reviews from critics. Despite the poor reception of the actual film, the band would near sell-out arenas on its respective tour, including Madison Square Garden in New York. Following several years of sporadic festival dates and special appearances, the band released their third album <i>Rize of the Fenix</i> on May 15, 2012, through Columbia Records, with the album making light of <i>The Pick of Destiny's</i> commercial failure.</p><p>In 2013, the band hosted the comedy music festival Festival Supreme in Los Angeles, which would go on to host three more editions. In 2014, the band were invited to feature on <i>Ronnie James Dio – This Is Your Life</i>, a compilation album where various artists cover Ronnie James Dio songs to raise funds for cancer. Their cover of ""The Last in Line"" won a Grammy for best heavy metal performance at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards. Following teases from Black and Gass regarding a second film, in late 2018, the band began independently releasing an animatic hand-drawn web series titled, <i>Tenacious D in Post-Apocalypto</i>, each of the six episodes uploading exclusively to YouTube every week starting September 28. Columbia Records released the album <i>Post-Apocalypto</i> on November 2, 2018, just after the release of the sixth episode.</p><p>Tenacious D's music showcases Black's theatrical vocal delivery and Gass's acoustic guitar-playing abilities. Critics have described their fusion of vulgar absurdist comedy with rock music as ""mock rock"". Their songs discuss the duo's purported musical and sexual prowess, as well as their friendship and cannabis usage in a style that music critics have compared with the storyteller-style lyrics of rock opera.</p>

</p>
<p><b>Avenged Sevenfold</b> (abbreviated as <b>A7X</b>) is an American heavy metal band from Huntington Beach, California, formed in 1999. The band's current lineup consists of lead vocalist and pianist M. Shadows, rhythm guitarist and backing vocalist Zacky Vengeance, lead guitarist, pianist, and backing vocalist Synyster Gates, bassist and backing vocalist Johnny Christ, and drummer Brooks Wackerman.
</p><p>Avenged Sevenfold are known for their diverse rock sound and dramatic imagery in album covers and merchandise. The band emerged with a metalcore sound on their debut album <i>Sounding the Seventh Trumpet</i> and continued this sound through their second album <i>Waking the Fallen</i>. However, the band's style had evolved by the group's third album and first major label release, <i>City of Evil</i>, into a heavy metal and hard rock style. The band continued to explore new sounds with its self-titled release and enjoyed continued mainstream success before their drummer, James ""The Rev"" Sullivan, died in 2009. Despite his death, Avenged Sevenfold continued on with the help of drummer Mike Portnoy (ex-Dream Theater), and released and toured in support of their fifth album <i>Nightmare</i> in 2010, which debuted on atop the <i>Billboard</i> 200, their first number one debut.</p><p>In 2011 drummer Arin Ilejay joined the band on tours and recording. The band's sixth studio album <i>Hail to the King</i>, which was released in 2013, marked the only Avenged Sevenfold album featuring Ilejay. <i>Hail to the King</i> charted as number 1 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200, the UK Albums chart, as well as the Finnish, Brazilian, Canadian, and Irish charts. In late 2014, Ilejay left the band, and was replaced by former Bad Religion drummer Brooks Wackerman, but the lineup change was not announced to the public until 2015. The band then surprise-released their seventh studio album titled <i>The Stage</i> on October 28, 2016, which debuted as number 4 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 chart in the US. <i>The Stage</i> is their first conceptual album and it marked another stylistic change for the band, moving towards a progressive metal sound.
</p><p>To date, Avenged Sevenfold have released seven studio albums, one live album/DVD, two compilation albums and eighteen singles and have sold over 8 million albums worldwide, and their records have received numerous certification awards, including five platinum album awards from their home country's institution (RIAA). They have also created four original songs for the <i>Call of Duty: Black Ops</i> series, all of which were compiled together in the 2018 EP <i>Black Reign</i>. The band were ranked No. 47 on <i>Loudwire's</i> list of Top 50 Metal Bands of All Time.</p>

Over the next four years, the band achieved several hit singles including ""Heart of Glass,"" ""Call Me,"" ""Atomic,"" ""The Tide Is High,"" and ""Rapture"". The band became noted for its eclectic mix of musical styles, also incorporating elements of disco, pop, reggae, and early rap music.
</p><p>Blondie disbanded after the release of its sixth studio album, <i>The Hunter</i>, in 1982.

The band re-formed in 1997, achieving renewed success and their sixth number one single in the United Kingdom with ""Maria"" in 1999, exactly 20 years after their first UK No. 1 single (""Heart of Glass"").
</p><p>The group toured and performed throughout the world during the following years, and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006.

<p><b>Ray Charles Robinson Sr.</b> (September 23, 1930 – June 10, 2004) was an American singer, songwriter, pianist and alto saxophonist. He is regarded as one of the most iconic and influential singers in history, and was often referred to by contemporaries as ""The Genius"". Among friends and fellow musicians he preferred being called ""Brother Ray"". Charles was blinded during childhood, possibly due to glaucoma.</p><p>Charles pioneered the soul music genre during the 1950s by combining blues, jazz, rhythm and blues, and gospel styles into the music he recorded for Atlantic Records. He contributed to the integration of country music, rhythm and blues, and pop music during the 1960s with his crossover success on ABC Records, notably with his two <i>Modern Sounds</i> albums. While he was with ABC, Charles became one of the first black musicians to be granted artistic control by a mainstream record company.</p><p>Charles's 1960 hit ""Georgia On My Mind"" was the first of his three career No. 1 hits on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. His 1962 album <i>Modern Sounds In Country And Western Music</i> became his first album to top the <i>Billboard</i> 200. Charles had multiple singles reach the Top 40 on various <i>Billboard</i> charts: 44 on the US R&amp;B singles chart, 11 on the Hot 100 singles chart, 2 on the Hot Country singles charts.</p><p>Charles cited Nat King Cole as a primary influence, but his music was also influenced by Louis Jordan and Charles Brown. He had a lifelong friendship and occasional partnership with Quincy Jones. Frank Sinatra called Ray Charles ""the only true genius in show business,"" although Charles downplayed this notion. Billy Joel said, ""This may sound like sacrilege, but I think Ray Charles was more important than Elvis Presley"".</p><p>For his musical contributions, Charles received the Kennedy Center Honors, the National Medal of Arts, and the Polar Music Prize. He was one of the inaugural inductees at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986. He has won 18 Grammy Awards (5 posthumously), the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1987, and 10 of his recordings have been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. <i>Rolling Stone</i> ranked Charles No. 10 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time, and No. 2 on their list of the 100 Greatest Singers of All Time.

<p><b>Steven Paul Smith</b> (August 6, 1969 – October 21, 2003), known professionally as <b>Elliott Smith</b>, was an American singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist. Smith was born in Omaha, Nebraska, raised primarily in Texas, and lived much of his life in Portland, Oregon, where he gained popularity. Smith's primary instrument was the guitar, though he also played piano, clarinet, bass guitar, drums, and harmonica. He had a distinctive vocal style, characterized by his ""whispery, spiderweb-thin delivery"", and often used multi-tracking to create vocal layers, textures, and harmonies.
</p><p>After playing in the rock band Heatmiser for several years, Smith began his solo career in 1994, with releases on the independent record labels Cavity Search and Kill Rock Stars (KRS). In 1997, he signed a contract with DreamWorks Records, for which he recorded his final two albums. Smith rose to mainstream prominence when his song ""Miss Misery""—included in the soundtrack for the film <i>Good Will Hunting </i>(1997)—was nominated for the 1998 Academy Award for Best Original Song.</p><p>Smith was a heavy drinker and drug user, and was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and depression. His struggles with drugs and mental illness affected his life and work, and often appeared in his lyrics. In 2003, aged 34, he died in Los Angeles, California, from two stab wounds to the chest. The autopsy evidence did not determine whether the wounds were self-inflicted. At the time of his death, Smith was working on his sixth studio album, <i>From a Basement on the Hill</i>, which was posthumously produced and released in 2004.

</p>
<p><b>Sir James Paul McCartney</b>  (born 18 June 1942) is an English singer, songwriter and musician who gained worldwide fame with the Beatles, for whom he played bass guitar and shared primary songwriting and lead vocal duties with John Lennon. One of the most successful composers and performers of all time, McCartney is known for his melodic approach to bass-playing, versatile and wide tenor vocal range, and musical eclecticism, exploring genres ranging from pre–rock and roll pop to classical, ballads, and electronica. His songwriting partnership with Lennon remains the most successful in history.</p><p>Born in Liverpool, McCartney taught himself piano, guitar and songwriting as a teenager, having been influenced by his father, a jazz player, and rock and roll performers such as Little Richard and Buddy Holly. He began his career when he joined Lennon's skiffle group, the Quarrymen, in 1957, which evolved into the Beatles in 1960. Sometimes called ""the cute Beatle"", McCartney later involved himself with the London avant-garde and spearheaded the incorporation of experimental aesthetics into the Beatles' studio productions. Starting with the 1967 album <i>Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</i>, he gradually became the band's <i>de facto</i> leader, providing the creative impetus for most of their music and film projects. Many of his Beatles songs, including ""And I Love Her"", ""Yesterday"", ""Eleanor Rigby"", and ""Blackbird"", rank among the most covered songs in history. While primarily a bassist with the Beatles, in various songs he played a number of other instruments, including keyboards, guitars, and drums.
</p><p>After the Beatles disbanded, he debuted as a solo artist with the 1970 album <i>McCartney</i> and formed the band Wings with his first wife, Linda, and Denny Laine. Led by McCartney, Wings was one of the most successful bands of the 1970s, and he wrote or co-wrote their US or UK number-one hits ""My Love"", ""Band on the Run"", ""Listen to What the Man Said"", ""Silly Love Songs"", and ""Mull of Kintyre"". He resumed his solo career in 1980 and has toured as a solo artist since 1989. Without Wings, his UK or US number-one hits have included ""Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey"" (with Linda), ""Coming Up"", ""Pipes of Peace"", ""Ebony and Ivory"" (with Stevie Wonder), and ""Say Say Say"" (with Michael Jackson). Beyond music, he has taken part in projects to promote international charities related to such subjects as animal rights, seal hunting, land mines, vegetarianism, poverty, and music education.
</p><p>McCartney has written or co-written a record 32 songs that have topped the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 and, as of 2009, had sales of 25.5 million RIAA-certified units in the US. His honours include two inductions into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (as a member of the Beatles in 1988 and as a solo artist in 1999), an Academy Award, a Primetime Emmy Award, 18 Grammy Awards, an appointment as a Member of the Order of the British Empire in 1965 and a knighthood in 1997 for services to music. As of 2020, he is one of the wealthiest musicians in the world, with an estimated fortune of £800 million.</p>

<p><b>Sir George Ivan Morrison</b>  (born 31 August 1945), known professionally as <b>Van Morrison</b>, is a Northern Irish singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist whose recording career spans seven decades. He has won two Grammy Awards.</p><p>As a teenager in the late 1950s, he played a variety of instruments such as guitar, harmonica, keyboards and saxophone for several Irish showbands, covering the popular hits of that time. Known as ""Van the Man"" to his fans, Morrison rose to prominence in the mid 1960s as the lead singer of the Northern Irish R&amp;B and rock band Them. With Them, he recorded the garage band classic ""Gloria"".
</p><p>Under the pop-oriented guidance of Bert Berns, Morrison's solo career began in 1967 with the release of the hit single ""Brown Eyed Girl"". After Berns's death, Warner Bros. Records bought out Morrison's contract and allowed him three sessions to record <i>Astral Weeks</i> (1968). While initially a poor seller, the album has become regarded as a classic. <i>Moondance</i> (1970) established Morrison as a major artist, and he built on his reputation throughout the 1970s with a series of acclaimed albums and live performances.
</p><p>Much of Morrison's music is structured around the conventions of soul music and early rhythm and blues. An equal part of his catalogue consists of lengthy, spiritually inspired musical journeys that show the influence of Celtic tradition, jazz and stream-of-consciousness narrative, such as the album <i>Astral Weeks</i>. The two strains together are sometimes referred to as ""Celtic soul"". His live performances have been described as ""transcendental"" and ""inspired"", and his music as attaining ""a kind of violent transcendence"".</p><p>Morrison's albums have performed well in Ireland and the UK, with more than 40 reaching the UK top 40. He has scored top ten albums in the UK in four consecutive decades, following the success of 2021's <i>Latest Record Project, Volume 1</i>. Eighteen of his albums have reached the top 40 in the United States, twelve of them between 1997 and 2017. Since turning 70 in 2015, he has released - on average - more than an album a year. He has received two Grammy Awards, the 1994 Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music, the 2017 Americana Music Lifetime Achievement Award for Songwriting and has been inducted into both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In 2016, he was knighted for services to the music industry and to tourism in Northern Ireland.</p>

</p>
<p><b>Scorpions</b> are a German rock band formed in Hanover in 1965 by guitarist Rudolf Schenker. Since the band's inception, its musical style has ranged from hard rock, heavy metal and glam metal to soft rock. The lineup from 1978 to 1992 was the most successful incarnation of the group, and included Klaus Meine (vocals), Rudolf Schenker (rhythm guitar), Matthias Jabs (lead guitar), Francis Buchholz (bass), and Herman Rarebell (drums). The band's only continuous member has been Schenker, although Meine has appeared on all of Scorpions' studio albums, while Jabs has been a consistent member since 1978, and bassist Paweł Mąciwoda and drummer Mikkey Dee have been in the band since 2003 and 2016 respectively.</p><p>During the mid-1970s, with guitarist Uli Jon Roth (who replaced Schenker's younger brother Michael) part of the lineup, the music of the Scorpions was defined as hard rock. After Roth's departure in 1978, Schenker and Meine took control of the group, giving them almost all the power to compose music and write lyrics. Matthias Jabs joined in 1978, and with the melodic rock he played and the influence of producer Dieter Dierks in the band, the Scorpions changed their sound to melodic heavy metal mixed with lyrical ""power rock ballads"", which is evident in the album <i>Lovedrive</i> (1979), which began the evolution of the band's sound, with recording a developed later in several of their albums. Michael Schenker also played on the Lovedrive album. Over the next decade, the band achieved influence, approval from music critics, and significant commercial success with the albums <i>Animal Magnetism</i> (1980), <i>Blackout</i> (1982), <i>Love at First Sting</i> (1984), the live recording <i>World Wide Live</i> (1985), <i>Savage Amusement</i> (1988), their best-selling compilation <i>Best of Rockers 'n' Ballads</i> (1989), and <i>Crazy World</i> (1990), all awarded at least one platinum award in the United States. The band has released thirteen consecutive studio albums that were in the top 10 in Germany, one of which reached No. 1, as well as three consecutive albums that were in the top 10 in the <i>Billboard</i> 200 in the United States. Their latest studio album, <i>Rock Believer</i>, was released in February 2022.
</p><p>Scorpions are estimated to have sold over 100 million records around the world, making them one of the best-selling hard rock and heavy metal bands. One of their most recognized hits is ""Wind of Change"" (from <i>Crazy World</i>), a symbolic anthem of the political changes in Eastern Europe in the late 1980s and early 1990s and the fall of the Berlin Wall, and it remains as one of the best-selling singles in the world with over 14 million copies. Two of the songs on their ninth studio album <i>Love at First Sting</i>, ""Rock You Like a Hurricane"" and ""Still Loving You"", are regarded as some of the most influential and popular works, both in heavy metal music and among rock ballads, defined as ""rock anthem"" and ""a true hymn of love"".</p>",Hanover

</p>
<p><b>Justin Drew Bieber</b> (<span></span> <i title=""English pronunciation respelling""><span>BEE</span>-bər</i>; born March 1, 1994) is a Canadian singer. Bieber is recognized for his genre-melding musicianship and global influence in modern-day popular music. He was discovered by American record executive Scooter Braun and signed with RBMG Records in 2008, gaining recognition with the release of his debut seven-track EP <i>My World</i> (2009) and soon establishing himself as a teen idol.
</p><p>Bieber achieved commercial success with his teen pop-driven debut studio album, <i>My World 2.0</i> (2010), which debuted atop the US <i>Billboard</i> 200, making him the youngest solo male act to top the chart in 47 years. The album spawned the internationally successful single ""Baby"" (featuring Ludacris), which became one of the best selling singles of all time in the US. His second studio album, <i>Under the Mistletoe</i> (2011), became the first Christmas album by a male artist to debut at number one in the US. Bieber experimented with dance-pop in his third studio album, <i>Believe</i> (2012), and went on to become the first artist in history with five US number-one albums by the age of 18. From 2013–14, Bieber was involved in multiple controversies and legal issues, which had a drastic impact on his public image.</p><p>In 2015, Bieber explored EDM with Jack Ü as a lead vocalist on ""Where Are Ü Now"", which won the Grammy Award for Best Dance/Electronic Recording. The song's musical direction played an instrumental role in his fourth studio album, <i>Purpose</i>, which produced three US number-one singles: ""Love Yourself"", ""Sorry"", and ""What Do You Mean?"". He became the first artist in history to occupy the entire top three of the UK Singles Chart. Bieber diversified on numerous collaborations between 2016 and 2017, including ""I'm the One"" and his remix to ""Despacito""—both reaching number one on the US <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 a week apart, making him the first artist in history to chart new number-one songs in consecutive weeks. ""Despacito"" was named the greatest Latin song of all time by <i>Billboard</i> and earned Bieber his career-first Latin Grammy Award. In 2019, he released a country collaboration with Dan + Shay, ""10,000 Hours"", which won the Grammy Award for Best Country Duo/Group Performance.</p><p>In 2020, Bieber released his R&amp;B-inspired fifth studio album, <i>Changes</i>, which debuted at number one in both the UK and US, and a standalone duet with Ariana Grande, ""Stuck with U"", which debuted atop the US <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. Bieber returned to his pop roots on his sixth studio album, <i>Justice</i> (2021). It produced the worldwide hit ""Peaches"" (featuring Daniel Caesar and Giveon) and debuted atop the US <i>Billboard</i> 200, making him the youngest soloist to have eight US number-one albums, a record held previously by Elvis Presley since 1965. The same year, Bieber released ""Stay"" (with the Kid Laroi), which became his eighth US number-one single.</p><p>Bieber is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with estimated sales of over 150 million records worldwide. He is credited with three Diamond certifications from the RIAA for ""Baby"", ""Sorry"" and ""Despacito"". He has received numerous accolades, including two Grammy Awards, one Latin Grammy Award, eight Juno Awards, two Brit Awards, one Bambi Award, 26 <i>Billboard</i> Music Awards, 18 American Music Awards, 22 MTV Europe Music Awards (the most wins for any artist), 23 Teen Choice Awards (the most wins for a male individual), and 33 Guinness World Records. <i>Time</i> named Bieber one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2011, and he was included on <i>Forbes</i><span>'</span> list of the top ten most powerful celebrities in 2011, 2012, and 2013.</p>",

</p>
<p><b>Ella Jane Fitzgerald</b> (April 25, 1917 – June 15, 1996) was an American jazz singer, sometimes referred to as the ""First Lady of Song"", ""Queen of Jazz"", and ""Lady Ella"". She was noted for her purity of tone, impeccable diction, phrasing, timing, intonation, and a ""horn-like"" improvisational ability, particularly in her scat singing.
</p><p>After a tumultuous adolescence, Fitzgerald found stability in musical success with the Chick Webb Orchestra, performing across the country but most often associated with the Savoy Ballroom in Harlem. Her rendition of the nursery rhyme ""A-Tisket, A-Tasket"" helped boost both her and Webb to national fame. After taking over the band when Webb died, Fitzgerald left it behind in 1942 to start her solo career. Her manager was Moe Gale, co-founder of the Savoy, until she turned the rest of her career over to Norman Granz, who founded Verve Records to produce new records by Fitzgerald. With Verve she recorded some of her more widely noted works, particularly her interpretations of the Great American Songbook.
</p><p>While Fitzgerald appeared in films and as a guest on popular television shows in the second half of the twentieth century, her musical collaborations with Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, and The Ink Spots were some of her most notable acts outside of her solo career. These partnerships produced some of her best-known songs such as ""Dream a Little Dream of Me"", ""Cheek to Cheek"", ""Into Each Life Some Rain Must Fall"", and ""It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)"". In 1993, after a career of nearly sixty years, she gave her last public performance. Three years later, she died at age 79 after years of declining health. Her accolades included 14 Grammy Awards, the National Medal of Arts, the NAACP's inaugural President's Award, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

</p>
<p><b>Kiss</b> (stylized as <b>KI<i>ϟϟ</i></b>) is an American rock band formed in New York City in 1973 originally composed by Paul Stanley (vocals, rhythm guitar), Gene Simmons (vocals, bass), Ace Frehley (lead guitar, vocals), and Peter Criss (drums, vocals). Known for their face paint and stage outfits, the group rose to prominence in the mid-1970s with shock rock-style live performances, which featured fire-breathing, blood-spitting, smoking guitars, shooting rockets, levitating drum kits, and pyrotechnics. The band has gone through several lineup changes, with Stanley and Simmons remaining the only consistent members. The current lineup consists of Stanley, Simmons, guitarist Tommy Thayer and drummer Eric Singer.
</p><p>With their makeup and costumes, the band members took on the personae of comic book-style characters: the Starchild (Stanley), the Demon (Simmons), the Spaceman or Space Ace (Frehley), and the Catman (Criss). Due to creative differences, Criss departed the band in 1980 and Frehley in 1982, though both would return later.
</p><p>In 1983, Kiss began performing without makeup and costumes, marking the beginning of the band's ""unmasked"" era that would last for over a decade. The band experienced a commercial resurgence during this era, with the 1983 platinum-certified album <i>Lick It Up</i> successfully introducing them to a new generation of fans, and its music videos receiving regular airplay on MTV. Eric Carr, who had replaced Criss in 1980, died in 1991 of heart cancer and was replaced by Eric Singer. In response to a wave of Kiss nostalgia in the mid-1990s, the original lineup reunited in 1996, which also saw the return of its makeup and stage costumes. The resulting reunion tour was highly successful, grossing $143.7 million, making it the band's most successful tour to date. Criss and Frehley subsequently left the band again, and have been replaced by Singer and Tommy Thayer, respectively. The band has continued with its original stage makeup, with Singer and Thayer using the original Catman and Spaceman makeup, respectively. In September 2018, Kiss announced that, after 45 years of recording and performing, it would embark on its final tour, the End of the Road World Tour, which started in January 2019 and is currently set to conclude in 2023.</p><p>Kiss is regarded as one of the most influential rock bands of all time, as well as one of the best selling bands of all time, claiming to have sold more than 100 million records worldwide, including 21 million RIAA-certified albums. Kiss has also earned 30 Gold albums, the most of any band from the United States. Kiss has 14 Platinum albums, three of which earned multi-Platinum. On April 10, 2014, the four original members of Kiss were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Kiss was ranked by MTV as the ninth ""Greatest Metal Band of All Time"", and placed tenth on VH1's ""100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock"" list, as well as being ranked as the third ""Best Metal and Hard Rock Live Band of All Time"" by <i>Loudwire</i> magazine.</p>",

<p><b>Sonic Youth</b> was an American rock band based in New York City, formed in 1981. Founding members Thurston Moore (guitar, vocals), Kim Gordon (bass, vocals, guitar) and Lee Ranaldo (guitar, vocals) remained together for the entire history of the band, while Steve Shelley (drums) followed a series of short-term drummers in 1985, rounding out the core line-up. Jim O'Rourke (bass, keyboards, guitar) was also a member of the band from 1999 to 2005, and Mark Ibold (bass, guitar) was a member from 2006 to 2011.
</p><p>Sonic Youth emerged from the experimental no wave art and music scene in New York before evolving into a more conventional rock band and becoming a prominent member of the American noise rock scene. Sonic Youth have been praised for having ""redefined what rock guitar could do"" using a wide variety of unorthodox guitar tunings while preparing guitars with objects like drum sticks and screwdrivers to alter the instruments' timbre. The band was a pivotal influence on the alternative and indie rock movements.
</p><p>After gaining a large underground following and critical praise through releases with SST Records in the late 1980s, the band experienced mainstream success throughout the 1990s and 2000s after signing to major label DGC in 1990 and headlining the 1995 Lollapalooza festival. The band disbanded in 2011 following the separation and subsequent divorce of Gordon and Moore with their final live shows taking place in Brazil. The members have since asserted that the band is finished and would not reunite.</p>",New York City

</p>
<p><b>Whitney Elizabeth Houston</b> (August 9, 1963 – February 11, 2012) was an American singer and actress. Nicknamed ""The Voice"", she is one of the bestselling music artists of all time, with over 200 million records sold worldwide. In 2023, <i>Rolling Stone</i> ranked her second on their list of the greatest singers of all time. Houston influenced many singers in popular music, and was known for her powerful, soulful vocals and vocal improvisation skills. She is the only artist to have had seven consecutive number-one singles on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100, from ""Saving All My Love for You"" in 1985 to ""Where Do Broken Hearts Go"" in 1988. Houston also enhanced her popularity upon entering the movie industry. Throughout her career and posthumously, she has received numerous accolades, including two Emmy Awards, six Grammy Awards, 16 <i>Billboard</i> Music Awards, and 28 Guinness World Records. Houston has also been inducted into the Grammy, Rhythm and Blues Music, and Rock and Roll halls of fame.
</p><p>Houston began singing in church as a child and became a background vocalist while in high school. She was one of the first black women to appear on the cover of <i>Seventeen</i> after becoming a teen model in 1981. With the guidance of Arista Records chairman Clive Davis, Houston signed to the label at age 19. Her first two studio albums, <i>Whitney Houston</i> (1985) and <i>Whitney</i> (1987), both peaked at number one on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 and are among the best-selling albums of all time. Houston's third studio album, <i>I'm Your Baby Tonight</i> (1990), yielded two <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 number-one singles: ""I'm Your Baby Tonight"" and ""All the Man That I Need"".
</p><p>Houston made her acting debut with the romantic thriller film <i>The Bodyguard</i> (1992), which became the tenth highest-grossing film to that date despite receiving poor reviews for its screenplay and lead performances. She recorded six songs for the film's soundtrack, including ""I Will Always Love You"" which won the Grammy Award for Record of the Year and became the best-selling physical single by a woman in music history. The soundtrack for <i>The Bodyguard</i> won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year and remains the bestselling soundtrack album of all time. Houston went on to star and record soundtracks for <i>Waiting to Exhale</i> (1995) and <i>The Preacher's Wife</i> (1996). Houston produced the latter's soundtrack, which became the bestselling gospel album of all time. As a film producer, she produced multicultural movies including <i>Cinderella</i> (1997) and series including <i>The Princess Diaries</i> and <i>The Cheetah Girls</i>.
</p><p>Houston's first studio album in eight years, <i>My Love Is Your Love</i> (1998), sold millions and spawned several hit singles, including ""Heartbreak Hotel"", ""It's Not Right but It's Okay"" and ""My Love Is Your Love"". Following the success, she renewed her contract with Arista for $100 million, one of the biggest recording deals of all time. However, her personal problems began to overshadow her career. Her 2002 studio album, <i>Just Whitney</i>, received mixed reviews. Her drug use and a tumultuous marriage to singer Bobby Brown received widespread media coverage. After a six-year break from recording, Houston returned to the top of the <i>Billboard</i> 200 chart with her final studio album, <i>I Look to You</i> (2009). On February 11, 2012, Houston accidentally drowned in a bathtub at the Beverly Hilton hotel in Beverly Hills, with heart disease and cocaine use as contributing factors. News of her death coincided with the 2012 Grammy Awards (which took place the day following her death), and was covered internationally.  
</p><p>An official biopic movie of Houston, titled <i>I Wanna Dance with Somebody</i>, was released in theaters on December 23, 2022.

<p><b>Jeffrey Scott Buckley</b> (November 17, 1966 – May 29, 1997), raised as <b>Scott Moorhead</b>, was an American singer, songwriter, and guitarist. After a decade as a session guitarist in Los Angeles, Buckley amassed a following in the early 1990s by performing cover songs at venues in East Village, Manhattan, such as Sin-é, while gradually focusing more on his own material. After rebuffing interest from record labels and Herb Cohen—the manager of his father, singer Tim Buckley— he signed with Columbia, recruited a band, and recorded what would be his only studio album, <i>Grace</i>, in 1994.
</p><p>Over the following three years, the band toured extensively to promote <i>Grace</i>, including concerts in the U.S., Europe, Japan, and Australia. In 1996, they stopped touring and made sporadic attempts to record Buckley's second album in New York City with Tom Verlaine as the producer.
</p><p>In 1997, Buckley moved to Memphis, Tennessee, to resume work on the album, to be titled <i>My Sweetheart the Drunk</i>, recording many four-track demos while also playing weekly solo shows at a local venue. On May 29, 1997, while awaiting the arrival of his band from New York, he drowned during a spontaneous evening swim, fully clothed, in the Mississippi River, where he was caught in the wake of a passing boat; his body was found on June 4.</p><p>Since his death, there have been many posthumous releases of his material, including a four-track collection of demos and studio recordings of his unfinished second album <i>My Sweetheart the Drunk</i>, expansions of <i>Grace</i>, and the <i>Live at Sin-é</i> EP. Chart success for Buckley came posthumously; with his cover of Leonard Cohen's ""Hallelujah"", Buckley attained his first number one on <i>Billboard</i><span>'</span>s Hot Digital Songs in March 2008 and reached number two in the UK Singles Chart that December. <i>Rolling Stone</i> included <i>Grace</i> in its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time and included Buckley in their list of the greatest singers.</p>

</p>
<p><b>Duran Duran</b> (<span></span>) are an English rock band formed in Birmingham in 1978 by singer and bassist Stephen Duffy, keyboardist Nick Rhodes, and guitarist/bassist John Taylor. With the addition of drummer Roger Taylor the following year, the band went through numerous personnel changes before May 1980, when they settled on their most famous line-up by adding guitarist Andy Taylor and lead vocalist Simon Le Bon.</p><p>When Duran Duran emerged they were generally considered part of the New Romantic scene. Innovators of the music video, Duran Duran were catapulted into the mainstream with the introduction of the 24-hour music channel MTV. The group was a leading band in the MTV-driven Second British Invasion of the US in the 1980s. Photographer Denis O'Regan, who captured the band during their 1984 tour, commented ""Duran Duran in America was like Beatlemania.""</p><p>The band's first major hit was ""Girls on Film"" (1981), from their self-titled debut album, the popularity of which was enhanced by a controversial music video. A heavily edited form played in rotation on MTV. The band's breakthrough second album was <i>Rio</i> (1982), which peaked at number six in the US, number two in the United Kingdom, and number one in Australia and Canada. The songs ""Hungry Like the Wolf"" and ""Rio"" featured cinematic music videos directed by Australian film maker Russel Mulcahy and became two of their biggest hits. ""Hungry Like the Wolf"" won the inaugural Grammy Award for Best Music Video in 1984. Their follow-up third album, <i>Seven and the Ragged Tiger,</i> became their only UK number one album and featured the US and UK number one single ""The Reflex"". In 1985, the band topped the US charts with the single ""A View to a Kill"" from the soundtrack of the James Bond film of the same name.
</p><p>Andy and Roger left the band before the recording of their fourth album, <i>Notorious</i> (1986), which yielded the top ten title track. The band spent the rest of the 1980s and early 1990s continuing to release albums and singles, to only moderate success. Their comeback album, 1993's <i>Duran Duran</i> (commonly called <i>The Wedding Album</i>), featured two top-ten worldwide hits ""Ordinary World"" and ""Come Undone"". After John Taylor left in 1997, the band released a number of albums and singles which underperformed on the sales charts. A full reunion of the line-up of Le Bon, Rhodes, and all three Taylors in 2001 led to a number of highly successful concert tours and the 2004 album <i>Astronaut</i>, which reached number 3 in the UK and top 40 in numerous other countries. The album's lead single ""(Reach Up for The) Sunrise"" was an international dance hit, and reached number five in the UK. Andy left again in 2006, and the band have released four additional albums, with the most recent being <i>Future Past</i> in 2021.
</p><p>Duran Duran have sold over 100 million records, making them one of the world's best-selling music artists. They achieved 30 top 40 singles in the UK Singles Chart  (14 of them top 10) and 21 top 40 singles in the US <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. The band have won numerous awards throughout their career: two Brit Awards including the 2004 award for Outstanding Contribution to Music, two Grammy Awards, an MTV Video Music Award for Lifetime Achievement, and a Video Visionary Award from the MTV Europe Music Awards. They were also awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The band was inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame as part of the class of 2022.</p>",Birmingham

</p>
<p><b>A Perfect Circle</b> is an American rock band formed in Los Angeles, California in 1999 by guitarist Billy Howerdel and Tool vocalist Maynard James Keenan. A Perfect Circle has released four studio albums, the first three during the early 2000s:  <i>Mer de Noms</i>, their debut album in 2000, and followed up by <i>Thirteenth Step</i> in 2003; then in 2004, <i>Emotive</i>—an album of radically re-worked cover songs. Shortly after <i>Emotive</i><span>'</span>s release, the band went on hiatus; Keenan returned to Tool and started up solo work under the band name Puscifer, while Howerdel released a solo album, <i>Keep Telling Myself It's Alright</i>, under the moniker Ashes Divide. Band activity was sporadic in the following years; the band reformed in 2010, and played live shows on and off between 2010 and 2013, but fell into inactivity after the release of their greatest hits album, <i>Three Sixty</i>, and a live album box set, <i>A Perfect Circle Live: Featuring Stone and Echo</i> in late 2013. The band reformed in 2017 to record a fourth album, <i>Eat the Elephant</i>, which was released on April 20, 2018.
</p><p>Prone to downtime due to Keenan's other musical commitments, the band has featured a variety of musicians throughout alternating periods of activity and inactivity, and has changed line-ups on each album, leaving Keenan and Howerdel the only constant members. The original incarnation of the band included Paz Lenchantin on bass, Troy Van Leeuwen on guitar, and Josh Freese on drums. Primus drummer Tim Alexander had briefly stood in as a drummer prior to Freese in the band's initial live shows; however, this was prior to releasing any material. Band collaborator and producer Danny Lohner and Marilyn Manson bassist Jeordie White were also members for a short period in the early 2000s. The band's current lineup features Smashing Pumpkins guitarist James Iha, bassist Matt McJunkins, and drummer Jeff Friedl, the latter two also being contributors to the related Puscifer and Ashes Divide projects. Despite the varied cast and numerous lineup changes, the stylistic content of A Perfect Circle's songs has remained consistent with Howerdel as music composer, and Keenan writing lyrics and vocal melodies. The band's studio albums have been generally well received critically and commercially, with their first three studio albums selling 4 million copies collectively as of 2005.</p>

<p><b>James Marshall</b> ""<b>Jimi</b>"" <b>Hendrix</b> (born <b>Johnny Allen Hendrix</b>; November 27, 1942 – September 18, 1970) was an American guitarist, singer and songwriter. Although his mainstream career spanned only four years, he is widely regarded as one of the most influential electric guitarists in the history of popular music, and one of the most celebrated musicians of the 20th century. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame describes him as ""arguably the greatest instrumentalist in the history of rock music.""</p><p>Born in Seattle, Washington, Hendrix began playing guitar at the age of 15. In 1961, he enlisted in the US Army, but was discharged the following year. Soon afterward, he moved to Clarksville then Nashville, Tennessee, and began playing gigs on the chitlin' circuit, earning a place in the Isley Brothers' backing band and later with Little Richard, with whom he continued to work through mid-1965. He then played with Curtis Knight and the Squires before moving to England in late 1966 after bassist Chas Chandler of the Animals became his manager. Within months, Hendrix had earned three UK top ten hits with the Jimi Hendrix Experience: ""Hey Joe"", ""Purple Haze"", and ""The Wind Cries Mary"". He achieved fame in the US after his performance at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967, and in 1968 his third and final studio album, <i>Electric Ladyland</i>, reached number one in the US. The double LP was Hendrix's most commercially successful release and his first and only number one album. The world's highest-paid performer, he headlined the Woodstock Festival in 1969 and the Isle of Wight Festival in 1970 before his accidental death in London from barbiturate-related asphyxia on September 18, 1970.
</p><p>Hendrix was inspired by American rock and roll and electric blues. He favored overdriven amplifiers with high volume and gain, and was instrumental in popularizing the previously undesirable sounds caused by guitar amplifier feedback. He was also one of the first guitarists to make extensive use of tone-altering effects units in mainstream rock, such as fuzz distortion, Octavia, wah-wah, and Uni-Vibe. He was the first musician to use stereophonic phasing effects in recordings. Holly George-Warren of <i>Rolling Stone</i> commented: ""Hendrix pioneered the use of the instrument as an electronic sound source. Players before him had experimented with feedback and distortion, but Hendrix turned those effects and others into a controlled, fluid vocabulary every bit as personal as the blues with which he began.""</p><p>Hendrix was the recipient of several music awards during his lifetime and posthumously. In 1967, readers of <i>Melody Maker</i> voted him the Pop Musician of the Year and in 1968, <i>Billboard</i> named him the Artist of the Year and <i>Rolling Stone</i> declared him the Performer of the Year. <i>Disc and Music Echo</i> honored him with the World Top Musician of 1969 and in 1970, <i>Guitar Player</i> named him the Rock Guitarist of the Year. The Jimi Hendrix Experience was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. <i>Rolling Stone</i> ranked the band's three studio albums, <i>Are You Experienced</i>, <i>Axis: Bold as Love</i>, and <i>Electric Ladyland</i>, among the 100 greatest albums of all time, and they ranked Hendrix as the greatest guitarist and the sixth-greatest artist of all time.

</p>
<p><b>James Joseph Brown</b> (May 3, 1933 – December 25, 2006) was an American singer, record producer, bandleader and actor. The central progenitor of funk music and a major figure of the 20th century, he is referred to by various honorific nicknames, some of which include ""the Hardest Working Man in Show Business"", ""Godfather of Soul"", ""Mr. Dynamite"", and ""Soul Brother No. 1"". In a career that lasted more than 50 years, he influenced the development of several music genres. Brown was one of the first 10 inductees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame at its inaugural induction in New York on January 23, 1986. 
</p><p>Brown began his career as a gospel singer in Toccoa, Georgia. He rose to prominence in the mid-1950s as the lead singer of the Famous Flames, a rhythm and blues vocal group founded by Bobby Byrd. With the hit ballads ""Please, Please, Please"" and ""Try Me"", Brown built a reputation as a dynamic live performer with the Famous Flames and his backing band, sometimes known as the James Brown Band or the James Brown Orchestra. His success peaked in the 1960s with the live album <i>Live at the Apollo</i> and hit singles such as ""Papa's Got a Brand New Bag"", ""I Got You (I Feel Good)"" and ""It's a Man's Man's Man's World"".
</p><p>During the late 1960s, Brown moved from a continuum of blues and gospel-based forms and styles to a profoundly ""Africanized"" approach to music-making, emphasizing stripped-down interlocking rhythms that influenced the development of funk music. By the early 1970s, Brown had fully established the funk sound after the formation of the J.B.s with records such as ""Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine"" and ""The Payback"". He also became noted for songs of social commentary, including the 1968 hit ""Say It Loud – I'm Black and I'm Proud"". Brown continued to perform and record until his death from pneumonia in 2006.
</p><p>Brown recorded and released 17 singles that reached No. 1 on the US <i>Billboard</i> R&amp;B charts. He also holds the record for the most singles listed on the US <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 chart that did not reach No. 1. Brown was posthumously inducted into the first class of the Rhythm &amp; Blues Music Hall of Fame in 2013 as an artist and then in 2017 as a songwriter. He also received honors from several other institutions, including inductions into the Black Music &amp; Entertainment Walk of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In Joel Whitburn's analysis of the US <i>Billboard</i> R&amp;B charts from 1942 to 2010, Brown is ranked No. 1 in the Top 500 Artists.

<p><b>Garbage</b> is an American rock band formed in 1993 in Madison, Wisconsin. The band's lineup—consisting of Scottish singer Shirley Manson (vocals) and American musicians Duke Erikson (guitar, bass, keyboards), Steve Marker (guitar, keyboards), and Butch Vig (drums, production)—has remained unchanged since its inception. All four members are involved in the songwriting and production process. Garbage has sold over 17 million albums worldwide.</p><p>The band's eponymous debut album was critically acclaimed upon its release, selling over four million copies and achieving double platinum certification in the United Kingdom, United States and in Australia. It was accompanied by a string of increasingly successful singles from 1995 to 1996, including ""Stupid Girl"" and ""Only Happy When It Rains"". Follow-up <i>Version 2.0</i>, released in 1998 after a year in production, was equally successful, topping the UK Albums Chart and receiving two Grammy Award nominations. Garbage followed this by performing and co-producing the theme song to the nineteenth James Bond film <i>The World Is Not Enough</i> (1999).</p><p>Garbage's third album <i>Beautiful Garbage</i> was also critically acclaimed, but failed to match the commercial success of its predecessors. Garbage quietly disbanded amidst the troubled production of their fourth album <i>Bleed Like Me</i>, but regrouped to complete the album, which was released in 2005 and peaked at a career-high number four in the U.S. The band cut short their <i>Bleed Like Me</i> concert tour and announced an indefinite hiatus, emphasizing that they had not broken up but rather wished to pursue separate interests. The hiatus was briefly interrupted in 2007, when the band recorded new tracks for their greatest hits album <i>Absolute Garbage</i>. The band reunited in 2011, and self-released their 2012 album <i>Not Your Kind of People</i> on their own label Stunvolume to positive reviews. Their next album, <i>Strange Little Birds</i>, followed in 2016. Their seventh studio album, <i>No Gods No Masters</i>, was released in 2021.</p>",Madison

</p>
<p><b>Pantera</b> (<span></span>) is an American heavy metal band from Arlington, Texas, formed in 1981, and currently composed of vocalist Phil Anselmo, bassist Rex Brown, and touring musicians Zakk Wylde and Charlie Benante. The group's best-known lineup consisted of the Abbott brothers (drummer Vinnie Paul and guitarist Dimebag Darrell), along with Brown and Anselmo, who joined in 1982 and 1986 respectively. In addition to their development and popularization of the groove metal subgenre, Pantera is credited (along with others, such as Testament, Sepultura, and Machine Head) for being part of the second wave of thrash metal scene from the late 1980s to early-to-mid 1990s. Pantera is regarded as one of the most successful and influential bands in heavy metal history, having sold around 20 million records worldwide and having received four Grammy nominations.</p><p>Having started as a glam metal band, Pantera released three albums in the mid-1980s with lead vocalist Terry Glaze (<i>Metal Magic</i>, <i>Projects in the Jungle</i>, and <i>I Am the Night</i>), with little success. Looking for a new and heavier sound, Pantera recruited Anselmo in 1986 and released <i>Power Metal</i> in 1988. They secured a record deal with major label Atco the following year. Their fifth album (which the band has since declared to be their official debut album), 1990's <i>Cowboys from Hell</i>, popularized the groove metal genre, while its 1992 follow-up <i>Vulgar Display of Power</i> achieved an even heavier sound and increased their popularity. The subsequent album <i>Far Beyond Driven</i> (1994) then debuted at number one on the <i>Billboard</i> 200.</p><p>Tensions began to surface among the band members when Anselmo, reeling from severe back problems brought on by years of intense on-stage performances, began growing distant from his bandmates in 1995, eventually becoming addicted to heroin as a result of his pain issues (he almost died from an overdose in July 1996). These tensions resulted in the recording sessions for <i>The Great Southern Trendkill</i> (1996) being held separately. The ongoing tension lasted for another seven years, during which only one studio album, <i>Reinventing the Steel</i> (2000), was recorded. Pantera went on hiatus in 2001 but lingering disputes led to the band breaking up in 2003. The Abbott brothers went on to form Damageplan while Anselmo continued to work on several side projects, including Down, which Brown joined as well.
</p><p>On December 8, 2004, Dimebag Darrell was shot and killed on stage by a mentally unstable fan during a Damageplan concert in Columbus, Ohio. Vinnie Paul went on to form Hellyeah after his brother's death, and died of heart failure in 2018, leaving Brown and Anselmo as the only surviving members of the band's best-known lineup. In July 2022, it was announced that Brown and Anselmo were reuniting in 2023 for Pantera's first tour in 22 years, with Zakk Wylde and Charlie Benante filling in for the Abbott brothers on guitar and drums, respectively. The new lineup played its first show in 21 years at the Hell and Heaven festival in Mexico on December 2, 2022, and the band's reunion tour will continue into 2024.</p>",Arlington

<p><b>Jefferson Airplane</b> was an American rock band based in San Francisco, California, that became one of the pioneering bands of psychedelic rock. Formed in 1965, the group defined the San Francisco Sound and was the first from the Bay Area to achieve international commercial success. They headlined the Monterey Pop Festival (1967), Woodstock (1969), Altamont Free Concert (1969), and the first Isle of Wight Festival (1968) in England. Their 1967 breakout album <i>Surrealistic Pillow</i> was one of the most significant recordings of the Summer of Love. Two songs from that album, ""Somebody to Love"" and ""White Rabbit"", are among <i>Rolling Stone</i><span>'</span>s ""500 Greatest Songs of All Time"".</p><p>The October 1966 to February 1970 lineup of Jefferson Airplane, consisting of Marty Balin (vocals), Paul Kantner (guitar, vocals), Grace Slick (vocals), Jorma Kaukonen (lead guitar, vocals), Jack Casady (bass), and Spencer Dryden (drums), was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996. Balin left the band in 1971. After 1972, Jefferson Airplane effectively split into two groups. Kaukonen and Casady moved on full-time to their own band, Hot Tuna. Slick, Kantner, and the remaining members of Jefferson Airplane recruited new members and regrouped as Jefferson Starship in 1974, with Balin eventually joining them. Jefferson Airplane received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2016.

<p><b>Stone Temple Pilots</b> (also known by the acronym <b>STP</b>) is an American rock band from San Diego, California, that originally consisted of Scott Weiland (lead vocals), brothers Dean (guitar) and Robert DeLeo (bass, backing vocals), and Eric Kretz (drums). The band's lineup remained unchanged from its formation in 1989 until the firing of Weiland in February 2013. Linkin Park vocalist Chester Bennington joined the band in May 2013 but left amicably in November 2015. In 2016, the band launched an online audition for a new lead vocalist; they announced Jeff Gutt as the new lead singer on November 14, 2017.
</p><p>After forming in 1989 under the name Mighty Joe Young, the band signed with Atlantic Records and changed its name to Stone Temple Pilots. Their debut album, <i>Core</i>, released in 1992, was a major commercial hit, and STP went on to become one of the most successful bands of the 1990s, selling more than eighteen million albums in the United States and forty million worldwide. STP released four more studio albums: <i>Purple</i> (1994), <i>Tiny Music... Songs from the Vatican Gift Shop</i> (1996), <i>No. 4</i> (1999), and <i>Shangri-La Dee Da</i> (2001), before separating in 2003, after which the band members partook in various projects (most notably Velvet Revolver and Army of Anyone). STP eventually reconvened in 2008 for a reunion tour, released their self-titled sixth album in 2010, and actively toured until Chester Bennington's departure. The band's only material with Bennington was the EP <i>High Rise</i>, in 2013. STP has released two albums with Gutt on vocals: its second self-titled album, on March 16, 2018 and eighth studio album, <i>Perdida</i>, on February 7, 2020.</p><p>While initially rising to fame as part of the grunge movement of the early 1990s, further releases from the band expressed a variety of influences, including psychedelic rock, bossa nova, and classic rock. STP's evolution throughout the 1990s and early 2000s involved periods of commercial highs and lows, brought about in part by Weiland's well-publicized struggles with drug addiction.

</p>
<p><b>Motörhead</b> (<span></span>) were  an English rock band formed in London in 1975 by Lemmy (lead vocals, bass), Larry Wallis (guitar) and Lucas Fox (drums). Lemmy was also the primary songwriter and only constant member. The band are often considered a precursor to the new wave of British heavy metal, which re-energised heavy metal in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Though several guitarists and drummers have played in Motörhead, most of their best-selling albums and singles feature drummer Phil ""Philthy Animal"" Taylor and guitarist ""Fast"" Eddie Clarke.
</p><p>Motörhead released 23 studio albums, 10 live recordings, 12 compilation albums and five EPs over a career spanning 40 years. Usually a power trio, they had particular success in the early 1980s with several successful singles in the UK Top 40 chart. The albums <i>Overkill</i>, <i>Bomber</i>, <i>Ace of Spades</i> and, particularly, the live album <i>No Sleep 'til Hammersmith</i> cemented Motörhead's reputation as a top-tier rock band. The band are ranked number 26 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock. As of 2016, they have sold more than 15 million albums worldwide.</p><p>Most often classified as heavy metal, Motörhead has been credited with being part of and influencing numerous musical scenes, thrash metal and speed metal especially. Lemmy, however, always insisted that they were a rock and roll band. He said that they had more in common with punk bands, but with their own unique sound, Motörhead is embraced in both punk and metal scenes. Their lyrics typically covered such topics as war, good versus evil, abuse of power, promiscuous sex, substance abuse and, most famously, gambling, the last theme being the focus of their hit song ""Ace of Spades"".</p><p>Lemmy died on 28 December 2015 from cardiac arrhythmia and congestive heart failure, after being diagnosed with prostate cancer. The day after his death, drummer Mikkey Dee and guitarist Phil Campbell both confirmed that Motörhead had disbanded. By 2018, all three members of Motörhead's best-known line-up (Lemmy, Taylor and Clarke) had died.</p>

</p>
<p><b>Johann Sebastian Bach</b> (31 March [O.S. 21 March] 1685 – 28 July 1750) was a German composer and musician of the late Baroque period. He is known for his orchestral music such as the <i>Brandenburg Concertos</i>; instrumental compositions such as the Cello Suites; keyboard works such as the <i>Goldberg Variations</i> and <i>The Well-Tempered Clavier</i>; organ works such as the <i>Schubler Chorales</i> and the Toccata and Fugue in D minor; and vocal music such as the <i>St Matthew Passion</i> and the Mass in B minor. Since the 19th-century Bach revival he has been generally regarded as one of the greatest composers in the history of Western music.</p><p>The Bach family already counted several composers when Johann Sebastian was born as the last child of a city musician in Eisenach. After being orphaned at the age of 10, he lived for five years with his eldest brother Johann Christoph, after which he continued his musical education in Lüneburg. From 1703 he was back in Thuringia, working as a musician for Protestant churches in Arnstadt and Mühlhausen and, for longer stretches of time, at courts in Weimar, where he expanded his organ repertory, and Köthen, where he was mostly engaged with chamber music. From 1723 he was employed as Thomaskantor (cantor at St Thomas's) in Leipzig. There he composed music for the principal Lutheran churches of the city, and for its university's student ensemble Collegium Musicum. From 1726 he published some of his keyboard and organ music. In Leipzig, as had happened during some of his earlier positions, he had difficult relations with his employer, a situation that was little remedied when he was granted the title of court composer by his sovereign, Augustus III of Poland, in 1736. In the last decades of his life he reworked and extended many of his earlier compositions. He died of complications after eye surgery in 1750 at the age of 65.
</p><p>Bach enriched established German styles through his mastery of counterpoint, harmonic, and motivic organisation, and his adaptation of rhythms, forms, and textures from abroad, particularly from Italy and France. Bach's compositions include hundreds of cantatas, both sacred and secular. He composed Latin church music, Passions, oratorios, and motets. He often adopted Lutheran hymns, not only in his larger vocal works, but for instance also in his four-part chorales and his sacred songs. He wrote extensively for organ and for other keyboard instruments. He composed concertos, for instance for violin and for harpsichord, and suites, as chamber music as well as for orchestra. Many of his works employ the genres of canon and fugue.
</p><p>Throughout the 18th century, Bach was primarily valued as an organist, while his keyboard music, such as <i>The Well-Tempered Clavier</i>, was appreciated for its didactic qualities. The 19th century saw the publication of some major Bach biographies, and by the end of that century all of his known music had been printed. Dissemination of scholarship on the composer continued through periodicals (and later also websites) exclusively devoted to him, and other publications such as the <i>Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis</i> (BWV, a numbered catalogue of his works) and new critical editions of his compositions. His music was further popularised through a multitude of arrangements, including the <i>Air on the G String</i> and ""Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring"", and of recordings, such as three different box sets with complete performances of the composer's oeuvre marking the 250th anniversary of his death.

<p><b>Lewis Allan Reed</b> (March 2, 1942 – October 27, 2013) was an American musician, songwriter, and poet.  He was the guitarist, singer, and principal songwriter for the rock band the Velvet Underground and had a solo career that spanned five decades. Although not commercially successful during its existence, the Velvet Underground became regarded as one of the most influential bands in the history of underground and alternative rock music. Reed's distinctive deadpan voice, poetic and transgressive lyrics, and experimental guitar playing were trademarks throughout his long career.
</p><p>Having played guitar and sung in doo-wop groups in high school, Reed studied poetry at Syracuse University under Delmore Schwartz, and had served as a radio DJ, hosting a late-night avant garde music program while at college.  After graduating from Syracuse, he went to work for Pickwick Records in New York City, a low-budget record company that specialized in sound-alike recordings, as a songwriter and session musician.  A fellow session player at Pickwick was John Cale; together with Sterling Morrison and Angus MacLise, they would form the Velvet Underground in 1965.  After building a reputation on the avant garde music scene, they gained the attention of Andy Warhol, who became the band's manager; they in turn became something of a fixture at The Factory, Warhol's art studio, and served as his ""house band"" for various projects.  The band released their first album, now with drummer Moe Tucker and featuring German singer Nico, in 1967, and parted ways with Warhol shortly thereafter.  Following several lineup changes and three more little-heard albums, Reed quit the band in 1970.
</p><p>After leaving the band, Reed would go on to a much more commercially successful solo career, releasing twenty solo studio albums. His second, <i>Transformer</i> (1972), was produced by David Bowie and arranged by Mick Ronson, and brought him mainstream recognition. The album is considered an influential landmark of the glam rock genre, anchored by Reed's most successful single, ""Walk on the Wild Side"". After <i>Transformer</i>, the less commercial but critically acclaimed <i>Berlin</i> peaked at No. 7 on the UK Albums Chart. <i>Rock 'n' Roll Animal</i> (a live album released in 1974) sold strongly, and <i>Sally Can't Dance</i> (1974) peaked at No. 10 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200; but for a long period after, Reed's work did not translate into sales, leading him deeper into drug addiction and alcoholism. Reed cleaned up in the early 1980s, and gradually returned to prominence with <i>The Blue Mask</i> (1982) and <i>New Sensations</i> (1984), reaching a critical and commercial career peak with his 1989 album <i>New York</i>.
</p><p>Reed participated in the re-formation of the Velvet Underground in the 1990s, and made several more albums, including a collaboration album with John Cale titled <i>Songs for Drella</i> which was a tribute to their former mentor Andy Warhol. <i>Magic and Loss</i> (1992) would become Reed's highest-charting album on the UK Albums Chart, peaking at No. 6.
</p><p>He contributed music to two theatrical interpretations of 19th century writers, one of which he developed into an album titled <i>The Raven</i>. He married his third wife Laurie Anderson in 2008, and recorded the collaboration album <i>Lulu</i> with Metallica. He died in 2013 of liver disease. Reed has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice; as a member of the Velvet Underground in 1996 and as a solo act in 2015.

<p><b>Crystal Castles</b> was a Canadian electronic music group formed in 2006 in Toronto, Ontario, formed by songwriter-producer Ethan Kath and singer-songwriter Alice Glass, who later left and was replaced by Edith Frances. Crystal Castles were known for their chaotic live shows and lo-fi melancholic homemade productions. They released many limited vinyl singles between 2006 and 2007 before releasing four studio albums between 2008 and 2016.
</p><p>Glass announced her departure from the band in October 2014, citing personal and professional reasons. Three years later, during the band's tour to support their fourth album, <i>Amnesty (I)</i>, Glass accused Kath of sexual misconduct during her time in Crystal Castles, causing the remaining tour dates to be cancelled. Crystal Castles has since been inactive, having provided no updates on new material or performances after Glass's allegations.

<p><b>Richard David James</b> (born 18 August 1971), best known as <b>Aphex Twin</b>, is an Irish-born British musician, composer and DJ. He is known for his idiosyncratic work in electronic styles such as techno, ambient, and jungle. Journalists from publications including <i>Mixmag</i>, <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>NME</i>, <i>Fact,</i> <i>Clash</i> and <i>The Guardian</i> have called James one of the most influential or important artists in contemporary electronic music.</p><p>Raised in Cornwall,  James began DJing at free parties and clubs in the area in the late 1980s. His debut EP <i>Analogue Bubblebath,</i> released in 1991 on Mighty Force Records, brought James an early following; he began to perform across the UK and continental Europe. James co-founded the independent label Rephlex Records the same year. His 1992 debut album <i>Selected Ambient Works 85–92</i>, released by Belgian label Apollo, garnered wider critical and popular acclaim. James signed to Warp in 1993 and subsequently released charting albums such as <i>...I Care Because You Do</i> (1995) and <i>Richard D. James Album</i> (1996), as well as Top 40 singles such as ""Come to Daddy"" (1997) and ""Windowlicker"" (1999); the latter two were accompanied by music videos directed by Chris Cunningham and brought James significantly wider international attention.
</p><p>After releasing <i>Drukqs</i> in 2001 and completing his contract with Warp, James spent several years releasing music on his own Rephlex label, including the 2005 <i>Analord</i> EP series under his <b>AFX</b> alias and a pair of 2007 releases as <b>the Tuss</b>. In 2014, he made available a previously unreleased 1994 LP as <b>Caustic Window</b>. He returned later that year with the Aphex Twin album <i>Syro</i> on Warp, winning the Grammy Award for Best Dance/Electronic Album.

As its lead rapper, he wrote some of Dre's and most of Eazy's lyrics on <i>Straight Outta Compton</i>, a landmark album that shaped West Coast hip hop's early identity and helped differentiate it from East Coast rap. N.W.A was also known for their violent lyrics, threatening to attack abusive police and innocent civilians alike, which stirred controversy. After a monetary dispute over the group's management by Eazy-E and Jerry Heller, Cube left N.W.A in late 1989, teaming with New York artists and launching a solo rap career.</p><p>Ice Cube entered cinema by playing Doughboy in director John Singleton's feature debut <i>Boyz n the Hood</i>, a 1991 drama named after a 1987 rap song that Ice Cube wrote.

</p>
<p><b>Miles Dewey Davis III</b> (May 26, 1926 – September 28, 1991) was an American trumpeter, bandleader, and composer. He is among the most influential and acclaimed figures in the history of jazz and 20th-century music. Davis adopted a variety of musical directions in a five-decade career that kept him at the forefront of many major stylistic developments in jazz.</p><p>Born in Alton, Illinois, and raised in East St. Louis, Davis left to study at Juilliard in New York City, before dropping out and making his professional debut as a member of saxophonist Charlie Parker's bebop quintet from 1944 to 1948. Shortly after, he recorded the <i>Birth of the Cool</i> sessions for Capitol Records, which were instrumental to the development of cool jazz. In the early 1950s, Davis recorded some of the earliest hard bop music while on Prestige Records but did so haphazardly due to a heroin addiction. After a widely acclaimed comeback performance at the Newport Jazz Festival, he signed a long-term contract with Columbia Records and recorded the album <i>'Round About Midnight</i> in 1955. It was his first work with saxophonist John Coltrane and bassist Paul Chambers, key members of the sextet he led into the early 1960s. During this period, he alternated between orchestral jazz collaborations with arranger Gil Evans, such as the Spanish music-influenced <i>Sketches of Spain</i> (1960), and band recordings, such as <i>Milestones</i> (1958) and <i>Kind of Blue</i> (1959). The latter recording remains one of the most popular jazz albums of all time, having sold over five million copies in the U.S.
</p><p>Davis made several line-up changes while recording <i>Someday My Prince Will Come</i> (1961), his 1961 Blackhawk concerts, and <i>Seven Steps to Heaven</i> (1963), another mainstream success that introduced bassist Ron Carter, pianist Herbie Hancock, and drummer Tony Williams. After adding saxophonist Wayne Shorter to his new quintet in 1964, Davis led them on a series of more abstract recordings often composed by the band members, helping pioneer the post-bop genre with albums such as <i>E.S.P</i> (1965) and <i>Miles Smiles</i> (1967), before transitioning into his electric period. During the 1970s, he experimented with rock, funk, African rhythms, emerging electronic music technology, and an ever-changing line-up of musicians, including keyboardist Joe Zawinul, drummer Al Foster, and guitarist John McLaughlin. This period, beginning with Davis's 1969 studio album <i>In a Silent Way</i> and concluding with the 1975 concert recording <i>Agharta</i>, was the most controversial in his career, alienating and challenging many in jazz. His million-selling 1970 record <i>Bitches Brew</i> helped spark a resurgence in the genre's commercial popularity with jazz fusion as the decade progressed.</p><p>After a five-year retirement due to poor health, Davis resumed his career in the 1980s, employing younger musicians and pop sounds on albums such as <i>The Man with the Horn</i> (1981) and <i>Tutu</i> (1986). Critics were often unreceptive but the decade garnered Davis his highest level of commercial recognition. He performed sold-out concerts worldwide, while branching out into visual arts, film, and television work, before his death in 1991 from the combined effects of a stroke, pneumonia and respiratory failure. In 2006, Davis was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, which recognized him as ""one of the key figures in the history of jazz"". <i>Rolling Stone</i> described him as ""the most revered jazz trumpeter of all time, not to mention one of the most important musicians of the 20th century,"" while Gerald Early called him inarguably one of the most influential and innovative musicians of that period.</p>",

</p>

<p><b>James Newell Osterberg Jr.</b> (born April 21, 1947), known professionally as <b>Iggy Pop</b>, is an American singer, musician, radio broadcaster, songwriter and actor. Called the ""Godfather of Punk"", he was the vocalist and lyricist of proto-punk band The Stooges, who were formed in 1967 and have disbanded and reunited many times since.</p><p>Initially playing a raw, primitive style of rock and roll (progressing later towards more experimental and aggressive rock), the Stooges sold few records in their original incarnation and gained a reputation for their confrontational performances, which often involved acts of self-mutilation by Pop. He had a long collaborative relationship and friendship with David Bowie over the course of his career, beginning with the Stooges' album <i>Raw Power</i> in 1973. Both musicians went to West Berlin to wean themselves off their respective drug addictions and Pop began his solo career by collaborating with Bowie on the 1977 albums <i>The Idiot</i> and <i>Lust for Life</i>, Pop usually contributing the lyrics. Throughout his career, he is well known for his outrageous and unpredictable stage antics, poetic lyrics and distinctive voice. He was one of the first performers to do a stage-dive and popularized the activity. Pop, who traditionally (but not exclusively) performs bare-chested, also performed such stage theatrics as rolling around in broken glass and exposing himself to the crowd.</p><p>Pop's music has encompassed a number of styles over the course of his career, including garage rock, punk rock, hard rock, heavy metal, art rock, new wave, jazz, blues and electronic. Though his popularity has fluctuated, many of Pop's songs have become well known, including ""Search and Destroy"" and ""I Wanna Be Your Dog"" by the Stooges, and his solo hits ""Lust for Life"", ""The Passenger"" and ""Real Wild Child (Wild One)"". In 1990, he recorded his first and only Top 40 U.S. hit, ""Candy"", a duet with B-52's singer Kate Pierson. Pop's song ""China Girl"" became more widely known when it was re-recorded by co-writer Bowie, who released it as the second single from his most commercially successful album, <i>Let's Dance</i> (1983). Bowie re-recorded and performed many of Pop's songs throughout his career.
</p><p>Although Pop has had limited commercial success, he has remained a culture icon and a significant influence on a wide range of musicians in numerous genres. The Stooges' album <i>Raw Power</i> has proved an influence on artists such as Sex Pistols, the Smiths, and Nirvana. His solo album <i>The Idiot</i> has been cited as a major influence on a number of post-punk, electronic and industrial artists including Depeche Mode, Nine Inch Nails and Joy Division, and was described by Siouxsie Sioux as a ""re-affirmation that our suspicions were true: the man is a genius."" He was inducted as part of the Stooges into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2010. In January 2020, Pop received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.</p>

<p><b>The Jackson 5 </b> (sometimes stylized as <b>the</b> <b>Jackson</b> <b>5ive</b>, also known as <b>the Jacksons</b>) are an American pop band composed of members of the Jackson family. The group was founded in 1964 in Gary, Indiana, and for most of their career consisted of brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon and Michael. They were managed by their father Joe Jackson. The group were among the first African American performers to attain a crossover following.
</p><p>The Jackson 5 performed in talent shows and clubs on the Chitlin' Circuit, then signed with Steeltown Records in 1967 and released two singles. In 1968, they left Steeltown Records and signed with Motown, where they were the first group to debut with four consecutive number one hits on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 chart with the songs ""I Want You Back"", ""ABC"", ""The Love You Save"", and ""I'll Be There"". They also achieved sixteen Top-40 singles on the chart. The group left Motown for Epic Records in early 1976, with the exception of Jermaine, who was replaced by youngest brother Randy. At Epic, they released four studio albums and one live album between 1976 and 1981, including the successful albums <i>Destiny</i> (1978) and <i>Triumph</i> (1980) and the singles ""Enjoy Yourself"", ""Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)"", and ""Can You Feel It"".
</p><p>The brothers also released solo albums, most successfully Michael. In 1983, Jermaine reunited with the band to perform on the <i>Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever</i> TV special. They released the <i>Victory</i> album the following year, followed by an extensive tour which also featured songs from Michael's solo albums. After the <i>Victory</i> tour, Michael and Marlon left the group. The remaining four released the poorly received <i>2300 Jackson Street</i> album in 1989 before being dropped from their label. In 2001, the Jacksons reunited on Michael's 30th Anniversary Celebration TV special. The four eldest of the brothers embarked on their Unity Tour in 2012 following Michael's death, and they planned several major performances for 2017.</p><p>According to some sources, the Jackson 5 have sold more than 100 million records worldwide. In 1980, the brothers were honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame as the Jacksons. They were inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997. Two of the band's recordings (""ABC"" and ""I Want You Back"") are among the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll and, alongside ""I'll Be There"", were also inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

The band has been through many personnel changes since their formation, with the current incarnation including drummer Hamish Rosser and bassist Brad Heald, both of whom are former members of The Vines. The original – and most commercially successful – line-up included bassist and keyboardist Chris Ross and drummer Myles Heskett. Ross and Heskett left Wolfmother after four years in 2008.
</p><p>Stockdale, Ross and Heskett formed Wolfmother in 2004 after several years of informal jamming.

It was released internationally by Interscope and Island Records the following year, and to date has sold in excess of 1.5 million copies worldwide. After Ross and Heskett departed, Stockdale rebuilt the band with the addition of bassist and keyboardist Ian Peres, rhythm guitarist Aidan Nemeth and drummer Dave Atkins, who released <i>Cosmic Egg</i> in 2009.
</p><p>In recent years, the line-up of Wolfmother has continued to change frequently, with their commercial popularity fluctuating.

</p>
<p>The <b>Electric Light Orchestra</b> (<b>ELO</b>) are  an English rock band formed in Birmingham in 1970 by songwriters and multi-instrumentalists Jeff Lynne and Roy Wood with drummer Bev Bevan. Their music is characterised by a fusion of pop, classical arrangements and futuristic iconography. After Wood's departure in 1972, Lynne became the band's sole leader, arranging and producing every album while writing nearly all of their original material. For their initial tenure, Lynne, Bevan and keyboardist Richard Tandy were the group's only consistent members.
</p><p>ELO was formed out of Lynne's and Wood's desire to create modern rock and pop songs with classical overtones. It derived as an offshoot of Wood's previous band, the Move, of which Lynne and Bevan were also members. During the 1970s and 1980s, ELO released a string of top 10 albums and singles, including the band's most commercially successful album, the double album <i>Out of the Blue</i> (1977). Two ELO albums reached the top of British charts: the disco-inspired <i>Discovery</i> (1979) and the science-fiction-themed concept album <i>Time</i> (1981). In 1986 Lynne lost interest in the band and disbanded the group. Bevan responded by forming his own band, ELO Part II, which later became the Orchestra. Apart from a brief reunion in the early 2000s, ELO remained largely inactive until 2014, when Lynne re-formed the band with Tandy as <b>Jeff Lynne's ELO</b>.</p><p>During ELO's original 13-year period of active recording and touring, they sold over 50 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling music groups of all time. They collected 19 CRIA, 21 RIAA, and 38 BPI awards. From 1972 to 1986, ELO accumulated 27 top 40 songs on the UK Singles Chart, and fifteen top 20 songs on the US <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. The band also holds the record for having the most <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 top 40 hits (20) without a number one single of any band in US chart history. In 2017, the key members of ELO (Wood, Lynne, Bevan and Tandy) were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.</p>",{{hlist

<p><b>Kendrick Lamar Duckworth</b> (born June 17, 1987) is an American rapper and songwriter. Known for his progressive musical styles and socially conscious songwriting, he is often considered one of the most influential hip hop artists of his generation. Born and raised in Compton, California, Lamar began his career as a teenager performing under the stage name K.Dot. He quickly garnered local attention which led to him signing a recording contract with Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE) in 2005.</p><p>After becoming a founding member of the hip hop supergroup Black Hippy, Lamar dropped his stage name and started using his first and middle names professionally. In 2011, he released his debut studio album <i>Section.80</i>, a conscious hip hop record. The album was met with positive reviews and included his debut single ""HiiiiPower"". In 2012, Lamar secured a record deal with Dr. Dre’s Aftermath Entertainment, under the aegis of Interscope Records, and released his second studio album <i>Good Kid, M.A.A.D City</i>. The West Coast and gangsta rap influenced album garnered widespread critical recognition and commercial success, while including the singles ""Swimming Pools (Drank),"" ""Backseat Freestyle,"" and ""Bitch, Don't Kill My Vibe"".</p><p>A visit to South Africa inspired Lamar’s jazz-flavored third studio album <i>To Pimp a Butterfly</i> (2015). It received universal acclaim and became his first number-one album on the <i>Billboard</i> 200. The same year, he topped the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 for the first time with the remix of ""Bad Blood"" by Taylor Swift. Lamar experimented with R&amp;B, pop and psychedelic soul in his fourth studio album <i>Damn</i> (2017). It spawned his first solo number-one single ""Humble"" and became the first non-classical and non-jazz work to be awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Music. Following a four-year hiatus, Lamar released his fifth studio album <i>Mr. Morale &amp; the Big Steppers</i> (2022), which served as his swan song from TDE. He has directed and produced several music videos and films with his creative partner Dave Free, with whom he founded the creative collective PGLang.
</p><p>Having sold over 70 million records in the United States alone, all of Lamar’s studio albums have been certified platinum or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

</p>
<p><b>Thomas Alan Waits</b> (born December 7, 1949) is an American musician, composer, songwriter, and actor. His lyrics often focus on the underbelly of society and are delivered in his trademark deep, gravelly voice. He worked primarily in jazz during the 1970s, but his music since the 1980s has reflected greater influence from blues, rock, vaudeville, and experimental genres.
</p><p>Waits was born and raised in a middle-class family in California. Inspired by the work of Bob Dylan and the Beat Generation, he began singing on the San Diego folk music circuit as a young man. He relocated to Los Angeles in 1972, where he worked as a songwriter before signing a recording contract with Asylum Records. His first albums were the jazz-oriented <i>Closing Time</i> (1973) and <i>The Heart of Saturday Night</i> (1974), which reflected his lyrical interest in nightlife, poverty, and criminality. He repeatedly toured the United States, Europe, and Japan, and attracted greater critical recognition and commercial success with <i>Small Change</i> (1976), <i>Blue Valentine</i> (1978), and <i>Heartattack and Vine</i> (1980). He produced the soundtrack for Francis Ford Coppola's film <i>One from the Heart</i> (1981), and subsequently made cameo appearances in several Coppola films.
</p><p>In 1980, Waits married Kathleen Brennan, split from his manager and record label, and moved to New York City. With Brennan's encouragement and frequent collaboration, he pursued a more experimental and eclectic musical aesthetic influenced by the work of Harry Partch and Captain Beefheart. This was reflected in a series of albums released by Island Records, including <i>Swordfishtrombones</i> (1983), <i>Rain Dogs</i> (1985), and <i>Franks Wild Years</i> (1987). He continued appearing in films, notably starring in Jim Jarmusch's <i>Down by Law</i> (1986), and also made theatrical appearances. With theatre director Robert Wilson, he produced the musicals <i>The Black Rider</i> (1990) and <i>Alice</i> (1992), first performed in Hamburg. Having returned to California in the 1990s, his albums <i>Bone Machine</i> (1992), <i>The Black Rider</i> (1993), and <i>Mule Variations</i> (1999) earned him increasing critical acclaim and multiple Grammy Awards. In the late 1990s, he switched to the record label ANTI-, which released <i>Blood Money</i> (2002), <i>Alice</i> (2002), <i>Real Gone</i> (2004), and <i>Bad as Me</i> (2011).
</p><p>Despite a lack of mainstream commercial success, Waits has influenced many musicians and gained an international cult following, and several biographies have been written about him.  In 2015, he was ranked at No. 55 on <i>Rolling Stone</i><span>'s</span> ""100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time"". He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2011.

</p>
<p><b>Charles Edward Anderson Berry</b> (October 18, 1926 – March 18, 2017) was an American singer, songwriter and guitarist who pioneered rock and roll. Nicknamed the ""Father of Rock and Roll"", he refined and developed rhythm and blues into the major elements that made rock and roll distinctive with songs such as ""Maybellene"" (1955), ""Roll Over Beethoven"" (1956), ""Rock and Roll Music"" (1957) and ""Johnny B. Goode"" (1958). Writing lyrics that focused on teen life and consumerism, and developing a music style that included guitar solos and showmanship, Berry was a major influence on subsequent rock music.</p><p>Born into a middle-class black family in St. Louis, Berry had an interest in music from an early age and gave his first public performance at Sumner High School. While still a high school student, he was convicted of armed robbery and was sent to a reformatory, where he was held from 1944 to 1947. After his release, Berry settled into married life and worked at an automobile assembly plant. By early 1953, influenced by the guitar riffs and showmanship techniques of the blues musician T-Bone Walker, Berry began performing with the Johnnie Johnson Trio. His break came when he traveled to Chicago in May 1955 and met Muddy Waters, who suggested he contact Leonard Chess, of Chess Records. With Chess, he recorded ""Maybellene""—Berry's adaptation of the country song ""Ida Red""—which sold over a million copies, reaching number one on <i>Billboard</i> magazine's rhythm and blues chart.</p><p>By the end of the 1950s, Berry was an established star, with several hit records and film appearances and a lucrative touring career. He had also established his own St. Louis nightclub, Berry's Club Bandstand. He was sentenced to three years in prison in January 1962 for offenses under the Mann Act—he had transported a 14-year-old girl across state lines for the purpose of having sexual intercourse. After his release in 1963, Berry had several more successful songs, including ""No Particular Place to Go"", ""You Never Can Tell"", and ""Nadine"". However, these did not achieve the same success or lasting impact of his 1950s songs, and by the 1970s he was more in demand as a nostalgia performer, playing his past material with local backup bands of variable quality. In 1972 he reached a new level of achievement when a rendition of ""My Ding-a-Ling"" became his only record to top the charts. His insistence on being paid in cash led in 1979 to a four-month jail sentence and community service, for tax evasion.
</p><p>Berry was among the first musicians to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on its opening in 1986; he was cited for having ""laid the groundwork for not only a rock and roll sound but a rock and roll stance."" Berry is included in several of <i>Rolling Stone</i> magazine's ""greatest of all time"" lists; he was ranked fifth on its 2004 and 2011 lists of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll includes three of Berry's: ""Johnny B. Goode"", ""Maybellene"", and ""Rock and Roll Music"". ""Johnny B. Goode"" is the only rock-and-roll song included on the Voyager Golden Record.</p>",

</p>
<p><b>ZZ Top</b> is an American rock band formed in 1969 in Houston, Texas. For 51 years, it was composed of vocalist-guitarist Billy Gibbons, drummer Frank Beard and vocalist-bassist Dusty Hill, until Hill's death in 2021. ZZ Top developed a signature sound based on Gibbons' blues guitar style and Hill and Beard's rhythm section. They are popular for their live performances, sly and humorous lyrics, and the matching appearances of Gibbons and Hill, who wore sunglasses, hats and long beards.
</p><p>ZZ Top formed after the demise of Moving Sidewalks, Gibbons' previous band, in 1969. Within a year, they signed with London Records and released <i>ZZ Top's First Album</i> (1971). Subsequent releases, such as <i>Tres Hombres</i> (1973) and <i>Fandango!</i> (1975), and the singles ""La Grange"" and ""Tush"", gained extensive radio airplay. By the mid-1970s, ZZ Top had become renowned in North America for its live act, including the Worldwide Texas Tour (1976–1977), which was a critical and commercial success.
</p><p>After a hiatus, ZZ Top returned in 1979 with a new musical direction and image, with Gibbons and Hill wearing sunglasses and matching chest-length beards. With the album <i>El Loco</i> (1981), they began to experiment with synthesizers and drum machines. They established a more mainstream sound and gained international success with <i>Eliminator</i> (1983) and <i>Afterburner</i> (1985), which integrated influences from new wave, punk, and dance-rock. The popularity of these albums' music videos, including those for ""Gimme All Your Lovin'"", ""Sharp Dressed Man"", and ""Legs"", gave them mass exposure on television channel MTV and made them prominent artists in 1980s pop culture. The <i>Afterburner</i> tour set records for the highest-attended and highest-grossing concert tour of 1986.
</p><p>After gaining additional acclaim with the release of their tenth album <i>Recycler</i> (1990), and its accompanying tour, the group's experimentation continued with mixed success on the albums <i>Antenna</i> (1994), <i>Rhythmeen</i> (1996), <i>XXX</i> (1999), and <i>Mescalero</i> (2003). They most recently released <i>La Futura</i> (2012) and <i>Goin' 50</i> (2019), a compilation album commemorating the band's 50th anniversary. By the time of Hill's death in 2021, ZZ Top had become the longest-running band with an unchanged lineup in the history of popular music. Per Hill's wishes, he was replaced by their longtime guitar tech Elwood Francis on bass.
</p><p>ZZ Top has released 15 studio albums and sold an estimated 50 million albums worldwide. They have won three MTV Video Music Awards, and in 2004, the members were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2015, <i>Rolling Stone</i> ranked Gibbons the 32nd greatest guitarist of all time. The band members have supported campaigns and charities including Childline, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, and a fundraiser for the Delta Blues Museum.

</p>

<p><b>Otis Ray Redding Jr.</b> (September 9, 1941 – December 10, 1967) was an American singer and songwriter. He is regarded as one of the greatest singers in the history of American popular music and a seminal artist in soul music and rhythm and blues. Nicknamed the ""King of Soul"", Redding's style of singing gained inspiration from the gospel music that preceded the genre. His singing style influenced many other soul artists of the 1960s.
</p><p>Redding was born in Dawson, Georgia, and at age two, moved to Macon. Redding quit school at age 15 to support his family, working with Little Richard's backing band, the Upsetters, and by performing in talent shows at the historic Douglass Theatre in Macon. In 1958, he joined Johnny Jenkins's band, the Pinetoppers, with whom he toured the Southern states as a singer and driver. An unscheduled appearance on a Stax recording session led to a contract and his first hit single, ""These Arms of Mine"", in 1962.
</p><p>Stax released Redding's debut album, <i>Pain in My Heart</i>, two years later. Initially popular mainly with African-Americans, Redding later reached a wider American pop music audience. Along with his group, he first played small shows in the American South. Redding later performed at the popular Los Angeles night club Whisky a Go Go and toured Europe, performing in London, Paris and other major cities. He also performed at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967.
</p><p>Shortly before his death in a plane crash, Redding wrote and recorded his iconic ""(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay"" with Steve Cropper. The song became the first posthumous number-one record on both the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 and R&amp;B charts. The album <i>The Dock of the Bay</i> was the first posthumous album to reach number one on the UK Albums Chart. Redding's premature death devastated Stax. Already on the verge of bankruptcy, the label soon discovered that the Atco division of Atlantic Records owned the rights to his entire song catalog.
</p><p>Redding received many posthumous accolades, including two Grammy Awards, the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the Black Music &amp; Entertainment Walk of Fame. and the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In addition to ""(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay"", ""Respect"" and ""Try a Little Tenderness"" are among his best-known songs.

</p>
<p><b>Megadeth</b> is an American thrash metal band formed in Los Angeles in 1983 by vocalist/guitarist Dave Mustaine. Known for their technically complex guitar work and musicianship, Megadeth is one of the ""big four"" of American thrash metal along with Metallica, Anthrax, and Slayer, responsible for the genre's development and popularization. Their music features complex arrangements and fast rhythm sections, dual lead guitars, and lyrical themes of war, politics, religion, death, and personal relationships.
</p><p>In 1985, Megadeth released their debut album, <i>Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!</i>, on the independent record label Combat Records, to moderate success. It caught the attention of bigger labels, which led to Megadeth signing with Capitol Records. Their first major-label album, <i>Peace Sells... but Who's Buying?</i>, was released in 1986 and was a major hit with the underground metal scene. Band members' substance abuse issues and personal disputes had brought Megadeth negative publicity during the late 1980s. Nonetheless, the band went on to release a number of platinum-selling albums, including <i>So Far, So Good... So What!</i> (1988), <i>Rust in Peace</i> (1990), and <i>Countdown to Extinction</i> (1992). These albums, along with worldwide tours, brought them public recognition.
</p><p>Megadeth has had numerous guitarists, drummers and bassists throughout its <span></span>40-year career, with Mustaine being the only remaining original member of the group. The band temporarily disbanded in 2002 when Mustaine suffered an arm injury and re-established in 2004 without longtime bassist David Ellefson, who had taken legal action against him. Ellefson settled out of court and rejoined the band in 2010, but was fired in 2021 amid allegations of sexual misconduct. Megadeth's current lineup includes Mustaine, bassist James LoMenzo, guitarist Kiko Loureiro and drummer Dirk Verbeuren.
</p><p>Megadeth earned platinum certifications in the United States for five of its sixteen studio albums, and has received twelve Grammy nominations. Megadeth won its first Grammy Award in 2017 for the song ""Dystopia"" in the Best Metal Performance category. The band's mascot, Vic Rattlehead, regularly appears on album artwork and live shows. Megadeth has hosted its own music festival, Gigantour, several times since July 2005, and held its first MegaCruise in October 2019.

<p><b>Leonard Norman Cohen</b>  (September 21, 1934 – November 7, 2016) was a Canadian singer-songwriter, poet, and novelist. Themes commonly explored throughout his work include faith and mortality, isolation and depression, betrayal and redemption, social and political conflict, and sexual and romantic love, desire, regret, and loss. He was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame, the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He was invested as a Companion of the Order of Canada, the nation's highest civilian honour. In 2011, he received one of the Prince of Asturias Awards for literature and the ninth Glenn Gould Prize.
</p><p>Cohen pursued a career as a poet and novelist during the 1950s and early 1960s, and did not begin a music career until 1967. His first album, <i>Songs of Leonard Cohen</i> (1967), was followed by three more albums of folk music: <i>Songs from a Room</i> (1969), <i>Songs of Love and Hate</i> (1971) and <i>New Skin for the Old Ceremony</i> (1974). His 1977 record <i>Death of a Ladies' Man</i>, co-written and produced by Phil Spector, was a move away from Cohen's previous minimalist sound.
</p><p>In 1979, Cohen returned with the more traditional <i>Recent Songs</i>, which blended his acoustic style with jazz, East Asian, and Mediterranean influences. Cohen's most famous song, ""Hallelujah"", was released on his seventh album, <i>Various Positions</i> (1984). <i>I'm Your Man</i> in 1988 marked Cohen's turn to synthesized productions. In 1992, Cohen released its follow-up, <i>The Future</i>, which had dark lyrics and references to political and social unrest.
</p><p>Cohen returned to music in 2001 with the release of <i>Ten New Songs</i>, a major hit in Canada and Europe. His eleventh album, <i>Dear Heather</i>, followed in 2004. In 2005, Cohen discovered that his manager had stolen most of his money and sold his publishing rights, prompting a return to touring to recoup his losses. Following a successful string of tours between 2008 and 2013, he released three albums in the final years of his life: <i>Old Ideas</i> (2012), <i>Popular Problems</i> (2014), and <i>You Want It Darker</i> (2016), the last of which was released three weeks before his death.  His  posthumous, fifteenth, and final studio album <i>Thanks for the Dance</i>, was released in November 2019.

</p>
<p><b>Billy Talent</b> is a Canadian rock band from Mississauga, Ontario. They formed in 1993 with lead vocalist Benjamin Kowalewicz, guitarist Ian D'Sa, bassist Jonathan Gallant, and drummer Aaron Solowoniuk. There have been no lineup changes, although Solowoniuk is currently taking a hiatus from the band due to a relapse of multiple sclerosis, In the 28 years since their inception, Billy Talent has sold well over a million physical albums in Canada alone and nearly 3 million albums internationally. Between 1995 and 2016, Billy Talent were the 27th-best-selling Canadian artist in Canada and among the top 10 best-selling Canadian bands in Canada.</p><p>The band existed for almost a decade before mainstream success. The members met and played in Our Lady of Mount Carmel Secondary School under the name <b>Pezz</b> and remained underground in Toronto's indie music scene until 2001. The band renamed itself Billy Talent after running into legal trouble with the old name. It was then that Kowalewicz's connection with an employee of Warner Music Canada's A&amp;R department landed the band a record deal and launched them into mainstream success. Since then, Billy Talent has made three multi-platinum records in Canada and continues to expand their success overseas; this included touring for 20 months supporting their second album. They released their third album, <i>Billy Talent III</i>, in 2009, and their fourth album, <i>Dead Silence</i>, in 2012. <i>Dead Silence</i> was followed up by a full UK tour throughout October and November 2012. To commemorate the longevity since the release of their first studio album, the band has released a greatest hits album entitled <i>Hits</i> in 2014. In 2015, they began to prepare material for their fifth studio album. Just before entering the studio, drummer Aaron Solowoniuk decided to sit out the recording sessions while he continued his longstanding battle with multiple sclerosis. Fellow Canadian Jordan Hastings was quickly recruited to play as Solowoniuk's studio stand-in, and, in early 2016, the group completed work on <i>Afraid of Heights</i>, which was released in July of that year. The band's most recent album is <i>Crisis of Faith</i>, released in January 2022.

The album featured drumming contributions from Bear, who would go on to join the project full-time in 2004, alongside Taylor and Rossen for live performances. Performing as a four-piece, the resulting chemistry turned Grizzly Bear into a band of equal collaborators, with Rossen becoming its co-lead vocalist and second principal songwriter, and Taylor adopting the role of producer and multi-instrumentalist. The band's second studio album, <i>Yellow House</i>, was released to widespread critical acclaim in 2006 and was the first to feature the full Grizzly Bear band.
</p><p>Preceded by the single ""Two Weeks"", the band's third studio album, <i>Veckatimest</i> (2009), increased their exposure significantly, reaching #8 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 and selling over 220,000 copies. After extensive touring, the band reconvened for the more experimental and expansive album, <i>Shields</i>, which was released to further acclaim in 2012. The band's fifth and most recent studio album, <i>Painted Ruins</i>, was released in 2017. Following the album's accompanying tour, the band entered an extended hiatus, with Droste announcing that he had left the band in 2020.</p>",Brooklyn

</p>
<p><b>Alice Cooper</b> (born <b>Vincent Damon Furnier</b>, February 4, 1948) is an American rock singer whose career spans over five decades. With a raspy voice and a stage show that features numerous props and stage illusions, including pyrotechnics, guillotines, electric chairs, fake blood, reptiles, baby dolls, and dueling swords, Cooper is considered by many music journalists and peers to be ""The Godfather of Shock Rock"". He has drawn equally from horror films, vaudeville, and garage rock to pioneer a macabre and theatrical brand of rock designed to shock audiences.</p><p>Originating in Phoenix, Arizona, in 1964, ""Alice Cooper"" was originally a band with roots extending back to a band called the Earwigs, consisting of Furnier on lead vocals and harmonica, Glen Buxton on lead guitar, and Dennis Dunaway on bass guitar and backing vocals. By 1966, Michael Bruce on rhythm guitar joined the three and Neal Smith was added on drums in 1967. The five named the band ""Alice Cooper"", and Furnier eventually adopted it as his stage pseudonym. They released their 1969 debut studio album with limited chart success. Breaking out with the 1970 single ""I'm Eighteen"" and the third studio album <i>Love It to Death</i>, the band reached their commercial peak in 1973 with their sixth studio album, <i>Billion Dollar Babies</i>. After the band broke up, Furnier legally changed his name to Alice Cooper and began a solo career in 1975 with the concept album <i>Welcome to My Nightmare</i>. Over his career, Cooper has sold well over 50 million records.</p><p>Cooper has experimented with a number of musical styles, mainly hard rock, glam rock, heavy metal, and glam metal, but also new wave (1980–1983), art rock on <i>DaDa</i> (1983), and industrial rock on <i>Brutal Planet</i> (2000) and <i>Dragontown</i> (2001). He helped to shape the sound and look of heavy metal, and has been described as the artist who ""first introduced horror imagery to rock'n'roll, and whose stagecraft and showmanship have permanently transformed the genre"". He is also known for his wit offstage, with <i>The Rolling Stone Album Guide</i> calling him the world's most ""beloved heavy metal entertainer"". Away from music, Cooper is a film actor, a golfing celebrity, a restaurateur, and, since 2004, a radio disc jockey (DJ) with his classic rock show <i>Nights with Alice Cooper</i>.

</p>
<p><b>Slayer</b> was an American thrash metal band from Huntington Park, California. The band was formed in 1981 by guitarists Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman, drummer Dave Lombardo and bassist/vocalist Tom Araya. Slayer's fast and aggressive musical style made them one of the ""big four"" bands of thrash metal, alongside Metallica, Megadeth, and Anthrax. Slayer's final lineup comprised Araya, King, drummer Paul Bostaph (who replaced Lombardo in 1992 and again in 2013) and guitarist Gary Holt (who replaced Hanneman in 2011). Drummer Jon Dette was also a member of the band.
</p><p>In the original lineup, King, Hanneman and Araya contributed to the band's lyrics, and all of the band's music was written by King and Hanneman. The band's lyrics and album art, which cover topics such as serial killers, torture, genocide, organized crime, secret societies, occultism, terrorism, religion or antireligion, fascism, racism and war, have generated album bans, delays, lawsuits and criticism from religious groups. However, its music has been highly influential, being cited by many bands as an influence musically, visually and lyrically; the band's third album, <i>Reign in Blood</i> (1986), has been described as one of the heaviest and most influential thrash metal albums.
</p><p>Slayer released twelve studio albums, three live albums, a box set, six music videos, two extended plays and a cover album. Four of the band's studio albums have received gold certification in the United States. Slayer sold 5 million copies in the United States from 1991 to 2013, according to Nielsen SoundScan, and over 20 million worldwide. The band has received five Grammy Award nominations, winning one in 2007 for the song ""Eyes of the Insane"" and one in 2008 for the song ""Final Six"", both of which were from the album <i>Christ Illusion</i> (2006). After more than three decades of recording and performing, Slayer announced in January 2018 that it would embark on a farewell tour, which took place from May 2018 to November 2019, after which the band disbanded.</p>

</p>
<p><b>Nightwish</b> is a Finnish symphonic metal band from Kitee. The band was formed in 1996 by lead songwriter and keyboardist Tuomas Holopainen, guitarist Emppu Vuorinen, and former lead singer Tarja Turunen. The band soon picked up drummer Jukka Nevalainen, and then bassist Sami Vänskä after the release of their debut album, <i>Angels Fall First</i> (1997). In 2001, Vänskä was replaced by Marko Hietala, who also took over the male vocalist role previously filled by Holopainen or guest singers.
</p><p>Although Nightwish have been prominent in their home country since <i>Angels Fall First</i>, they did not achieve wider success until the release of the albums <i>Oceanborn</i> (1998), <i>Wishmaster</i> (2000) and <i>Century Child</i> (2002). Their 2004 album, <i>Once</i>, has sold more than one million copies and was the band's breakthrough in the United States. Their biggest US hit single, ""Wish I Had an Angel"" (2004), received MTV airplay and was included on three US film soundtracks to promote their North American tour. The band produced three more singles and two music videos for <i>Once</i>, as well as a re-recording of ""Sleeping Sun"" for the compilation album, <i>Highest Hopes: The Best of Nightwish</i> (2005), before Turunen's dismissal in October 2005. Her last performance with Nightwish was during a concert recorded for the live album/DVD <i>End of an Era</i>.

</p>
<p><b>Judas Priest</b> are an English heavy metal band formed in Birmingham in 1969. They have sold over 50 million albums and are frequently ranked as one of the greatest metal bands of all time. Despite an innovative and pioneering body of work in the latter half of the 1970s, the band had struggled with indifferent record production and a lack of major commercial success until 1980, when they rose to commercial success with the album <i>British Steel</i>.
</p><p>The band's membership has seen much turnover, including a revolving cast of drummers in the 1970s and the departure of singer Rob Halford in 1992. Tim ""Ripper"" Owens, formerly of Winter's Bane, replaced Halford in 1996 and recorded two albums with Judas Priest, before Halford returned to the band in 2003. The current line-up consists of Halford, guitarists Glenn Tipton and Richie Faulkner, bassist Ian Hill and drummer Scott Travis. The band's best-selling album is 1982's <i>Screaming for Vengeance</i>, with their most commercially successful line-up featuring Hill, Halford, Tipton, guitarist K. K. Downing, and drummer Dave Holland. Although not original members, Tipton and Hill are the only two of the band to appear on every album.
</p><p>Halford's operatic vocal style and the twin guitar sound of Downing and Tipton have been a major influence on heavy metal bands. Judas Priest's image of leather, spikes, and other taboo articles of clothing were widely influential during the glam metal era of the 1980s. <i>The Guardian</i> referred to <i>British Steel</i> as the record that defines heavy metal. Despite a decline in exposure during the mid-1990s, the band has once again seen a resurgence, including worldwide tours, being inaugural inductees into the VH1 Rock Honors in 2006, receiving a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 2010, and having their songs featured in video games such as <i>Guitar Hero</i> and the <i>Rock Band</i> series. In 2022, Judas Priest were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.</p>",Birmingham

The band was later expanded to include members Ben Mount, Peredur ap Gwynedd and KJ Sawka. Members Swire and McGrillen also formed the electro house duo Knife Party. The group is notable for its distinctive sound, mixing electronic music with hard rock and covering a wide range of genres.
</p><p>In 2003, Swire, McGrillen and Harding relocated to the United Kingdom. The debut studio album, <i>Hold Your Colour</i>, was released in 2005 to positive critical reception. While <i>Hold Your Colour</i> was mostly of the drum &amp; bass genre, the succeeding albums <i>In Silico</i> and <i>Immersion</i> saw experimentation of other genres such as industrial rock and electronic rock.
</p><p>In August 2013, Swire announced that a new album may be released in 2014, although Swire and McGrillen later confessed on their Reddit AMA that they had become disillusioned with Pendulum and have no interest at present in producing any new material. Despite this, on 20 March 2016, Pendulum reunited to perform at the Ultra Music Festival in Miami, Florida, marking their official return as a live act. Soon after this, Swire, via Twitter, said that he would make a new Pendulum album, and later clarified that a remix album, <i>The Reworks</i>, would come first, followed by new material.

</p>
<p><b>Sir Roderick David Stewart</b>  (born 10 January 1945) is a British rock and pop singer and songwriter. Born and raised in London, he is of Scottish and English ancestry. With his distinctive raspy singing voice, Stewart is among the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold over 250 million records worldwide. He has had 10 number-one albums and 31 top ten singles in the UK, six of which reached number one. Stewart has had 16 top ten singles in the US, with four reaching number one on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. He was knighted in the 2016 Birthday Honours for services to music and charity.</p><p>Stewart's music career began in 1962 when he took up busking with a harmonica. In 1963, he joined The Dimensions as a harmonica player and vocalist. In 1964, Stewart joined Long John Baldry and the All Stars before moving to the Jeff Beck Group in 1967. Joining Faces in 1969, he also maintained a solo career releasing his debut album that year. Stewart's early albums were a fusion of rock, folk music, soul music, and R&amp;B.  His third album, 1971's <i>Every Picture Tells a Story</i>, was his breakthrough, topping the charts in the UK, US, Canada and Australia, as did its ballad ""Maggie May"". His 1972 follow-up album, <i>Never a Dull Moment</i>, also reached number one in the UK and Australia, while going top three in the US and Canada. Its single, ""You Wear It Well"", topped the chart in the UK and was a moderate hit elsewhere.
</p><p>After Stewart had a handful more UK top ten hits, the Faces broke up in 1975. Stewart's next few hit singles were ballads with ""Sailing"", off the 1975 UK and Australian number-one album, <i>Atlantic Crossing</i>, becoming a hit in the UK and the Netherlands (number one), Germany (number four) and other countries, but barely charting in North America. <i>A Night on the Town</i> (1976), his fifth straight chart-topper in the UK, began a three-album run of going number one or top three in the US, Canada, the UK and Australia with each release. That album's ""Tonight's the Night (Gonna Be Alright)"" spent almost two months at number one in the US and Canada, and made the top five in other countries. <i>Foot Loose &amp; Fancy Free</i> (1977) contained the hit ""You're in My Heart (The Final Acclaim)"" as well as the rocker ""Hot Legs"". <i>Blondes Have More Fun</i> (1978) and its disco-tinged ""Da Ya Think I'm Sexy"" both went to number one in Canada, Australia and the US, with ""Da Ya Think I'm Sexy"" also hitting number one in the UK and the top ten in other countries. Stewart's albums regularly hit the upper rungs of the charts in the Netherlands throughout the 70s and in Sweden from 1975 onward.
</p><p>After a disco and new wave period in the late 1970s and early 1980s, Stewart's music turned to a soft rock/middle-of-the-road style, with most of his albums reaching the top ten in the UK, Germany and Sweden, but faring less well in the US. The single ""Rhythm of My Heart"" was a top five hit in the UK, US and other countries, with its source album, 1991's <i>Vagabond Heart</i>, becoming, at number ten in the US and number two in the UK, his highest-charting album in a decade. In 1993, he collaborated with Bryan Adams and Sting on the power ballad ""All for Love"", which went to number one in many countries. In the early 2000s, he released a series of successful albums interpreting the Great American Songbook. 
</p><p>In 2008, <i>Billboard</i> magazine ranked him the 17th most successful artist on the ""<i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists"". A Grammy and Brit Award recipient, he was voted at No. 33 in <i>Q Magazine</i><span>'</span>s list of the Top 100 Greatest Singers of all time.  As a solo artist, Stewart was inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994, the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2006, and he was inducted a second time into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012 as a member of Faces.</p>

<p><b>Drowning Pool</b> is an American rock band formed in Dallas, Texas, in 1996. The band was named after the 1975 film <i>The Drowning Pool</i>. Since its formation, the band has consisted of guitarist C.J. Pierce, bassist Stevie Benton, and drummer Mike Luce, as well as a revolving cast of vocalists, the latest being Jasen Moreno.
</p><p>After the release of their debut album, <i>Sinner</i> (2001), original vocalist Dave Williams was found dead on August 14, 2002 from  heart disease. Jason Jones, who replaced Williams in 2003, recorded one album, <i>Desensitized</i> (2004), but left in 2005 due to musical differences. Ryan McCombs of <span>Chicago-based</span> band SOiL, later replaced Jones and released two albums, <i>Full Circle</i> (2007) and <i>Drowning Pool</i> (2010), making it the first time Drowning Pool had not switched singers after just one album. However, McCombs left the band in 2011 to rejoin SOiL. Jasen Moreno was announced as McCombs' replacement in 2012, and the band has since recorded three albums with him: <i>Resilience</i> (2013), <i>Hellelujah</i> (2016) and <i>Strike a Nerve</i> (2022).

</p>
<p><b>The Libertines</b> are an English rock band, formed in London in 1997 by frontmen Carl Barât (vocals/guitar) and Pete Doherty (vocals/guitar). The band, centred on the songwriting partnership of Barât and Doherty, has also included John Hassall (bass), and Gary Powell (drums) for most of its recording career. The band was part of the garage rock revival and spearheaded the movement in the UK.
</p><p>The band gained some notoriety in the early 2000s, due to Doherty's use of illegal drugs and conflicts between Barât and Doherty. Although their mainstream success was initially limited, their profile soon grew, culminating in a No. 2 single and No. 1 album on the UK Charts. In December 2004, their self-titled second album was voted the second best album of the year by <i>NME</i> magazine. The first two of their full-length LPs were produced by Mick Jones, of the British punk band The Clash.
</p><p>In spite of their critical and commercial success, the band's music was often eclipsed by its internal conflicts, stemming from Doherty's addictions to crack cocaine and heroin, which eventually led to the break-up of the band. Doherty has since stated that the break-up of the band was due to relationship difficulties between Barât and himself that were not related to his drug addictions. The members of the Libertines went on to form new bands with varying degrees of success.
</p><p>In August 2010, the four members of the Libertines reunited to play a series of shows, including slots at the 2010 Reading and Leeds Festivals. The reunion shows received a highly positive response from the press and fans. In April 2014 the Libertines announced they would again reform for a show at London's Hyde Park. In November 2014 the band signed a record deal with Virgin EMI Records, and released their third album, <i>Anthems for Doomed Youth</i> on 11 September 2015.</p>",London

<p><b>Paul Frederic Simon</b> (born October 13, 1941) is an American musician, singer, songwriter and actor whose career has spanned six decades. He is one of the most acclaimed songwriters in popular music, both as a solo artist and as half of folk rock duo Simon &amp; Garfunkel with Art Garfunkel.
</p><p>Simon was born in Newark, New Jersey, and grew up in the borough of Queens in New York City. He began performing with his schoolfriend Art Garfunkel in 1956 when they were still in their early teens. After limited success, the pair reunited after an electrified version of their song ""The Sound of Silence"" became a hit in 1966. Simon &amp; Garfunkel recorded five albums together featuring songs mostly written by Simon, including the hits ""Mrs. Robinson"", ""America"", ""Bridge over Troubled Water"" and ""The Boxer"".</p><p>After Simon &amp; Garfunkel split in 1970, Simon recorded three acclaimed albums over the following five years, all of which charted in the Top 5 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200. His 1972 self-titled album contained the hit songs ""Mother and Child Reunion"" and ""Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard"". The 1975 album <i>Still Crazy After All These Years</i>, which featured guest vocals from Garfunkel, was his first number one solo album. It featured the number 1 hit single ""50 Ways to Leave Your Lover"", among other Top 40 songs such as ""Still Crazy After All These Years"", ""Gone at Last"" and ""My Little Town"".
</p><p>Simon reunited with Garfunkel for a performance in New York Central Park in 1981, drawing half a million spectators, followed by a world tour with Garfunkel. After a career slump, Simon released <i>Graceland</i> in 1986, an album inspired by South African township music. It sold 14 million copies worldwide, and remains his most popular and acclaimed solo work. A number of hit singles were released from the album, including ""You Can Call Me Al"", ""The Boy in the Bubble"" and ""Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes"". It won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1987.
</p><p>Simon continued to tour throughout the 1990s. He wrote a Broadway musical, <i>The Capeman,</i> and recorded a companion album, <i>Songs from The Capeman</i>, which was released in 1997. His 2000 album <i>You're the One</i> was nominated again for Album of the Year honors. He followed that album with several years of touring, including another reunion tour with Garfunkel. He then released <i>Surprise</i> (2006), his last album of the decade. In 2016, he released <i>Stranger to Stranger</i>, which debuted at number 3 on the Billboard Album Chart and number 1 the UK Albums Chart. It marked his greatest commercial and critical success in thirty years. His most recent album is <i>In the Blue Light</i> (2018), which contains re-arrangements of lesser-known songs from his prior albums.
</p><p>Simon has earned sixteen Grammy Awards for his solo and collaborative work, including three for Album of the Year (<i>Bridge Over Troubled Water</i>, <i>Still Crazy After All These Years</i> and <i>Graceland</i>), and a Lifetime Achievement Award. He is a two-time inductee into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame: first in 1990 as a member of Simon &amp; Garfunkel, and again in 2001 for his solo career. In 2006 he was selected as one of the ""100 People Who Shaped the World"" by <i>Time</i>. In 2011, <i>Rolling Stone</i> named Simon one of the 100 greatest guitarists, and in 2015 he was ranked 8th in their list of the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time. Simon was the first recipient of the Library of Congress's Gershwin Prize for Popular Song in 2007.</p>

<p><b>A Tribe Called Quest</b> was an American hip hop group formed in Queens, New York City, in 1985, originally composed of rapper and main producer Q-Tip, rapper Phife Dawg, DJ and co-producer Ali Shaheed Muhammad, and rapper Jarobi White. Members of the Native Tongues collective, the group is regarded as a pioneer of alternative hip hop, influencing numerous hip hop and R&amp;B musicians.</p><p>The group's debut album, <i>People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm</i> (1990), established them as a critically acclaimed act, earning the first five 'mic' rating in <i>The Source</i><span>'</span>s history. In 1991, the group saw commercial success with its jazz-infused second album, <i>The Low End Theory</i>, which heavily shaped alternative hip hop in the 1990s. It was followed by the similarly successful and influential <i>Midnight Marauders</i> (1993), and <i>Beats, Rhymes and Life</i> (1996), which topped the <i>Billboard</i> 200. In 1998, the group disbanded shortly before releasing its fifth album <i>The Love Movement</i>, but in 2006, the original members reunited and toured sporadically for the next seven years. In 2016, the group released its sixth and final album, <i>We Got It from Here...

John Bush of AllMusic called them ""the most intelligent, artistic rap group during the 1990s"". Kris Ex of <i>Pitchfork</i> regarded them as ""one of the greatest acts that hip-hop has ever produced"". In 2005, A Tribe Called Quest received the Founders Award at the <i>Billboard</i> R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Awards, and two years later, the group was honored at the 4th VH1 Hip Hop Honors. In 2017, the group was awarded the Brit Award for International Group.

</p>
<p><b>Wilco</b> is an American alternative rock band based in Chicago, Illinois. The band was formed in 1994 by the remaining members of alternative country group Uncle Tupelo following singer Jay Farrar's departure. Wilco's lineup changed frequently during its first decade, with only singer Jeff Tweedy and bassist John Stirratt remaining from the original incarnation. Since early 2004, the lineup has been unchanged, consisting of Tweedy, Stirratt, guitarist Nels Cline, multi-instrumentalist Pat Sansone, keyboard player Mikael Jorgensen, and drummer Glenn Kotche. Wilco has released twelve studio albums, a live double album, and four collaborations: three with Billy Bragg and one with The Minus 5.
</p><p>Wilco's music has been inspired by a wide variety of artists and styles, including Bill Fay, The Beatles and Television, and has in turn influenced music by a number of modern alternative rock acts. The band continued in the alternative country style of Uncle Tupelo on its debut album <i>A.M.</i> (1995), but has since introduced more experimental aspects to their music, including elements of alternative rock and classic pop. Wilco's musical style has evolved from a 1990s country rock sound to a current ""eclectic indie rock collective that touches on many eras and genres"".</p><p>Wilco garnered media attention for their fourth album, <i>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</i> (2001), and the controversy surrounding it. After the recording sessions were complete, Reprise Records rejected the album and dismissed Wilco from the label. As part of a buy-out deal, Reprise gave Wilco the rights to the album for free. After streaming <i>Foxtrot</i> on its website, Wilco sold the album to Nonesuch Records in 2002. Both record labels are subsidiaries of Warner Music Group, leading one critic to say the album showed ""how screwed up the music business is in the early twenty-first century."" <i>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</i> is Wilco's most successful release to date, selling over 670,000 copies. Wilco won two Grammy Awards for their fifth studio album, 2004's <i>A Ghost Is Born</i>, including Best Alternative Music Album. Wilco released their twelfth studio album, <i>Cruel Country</i>, in May 2022.

<p><b>Yusuf Islam</b> (born <b>Steven Demetre Georgiou</b>; <span>21 July 1948</span>), commonly known by his stage names <b>Cat Stevens</b>, <b>Yusuf</b>, and <b>Yusuf / Cat Stevens</b>,  is a British singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist. His musical style consists of folk, pop, rock, and, later in his career, Islamic music. Following two decades in which he only performed music which met strict religious standards, he returned to making secular music in 2006. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2014.</p><p>His 1967 debut album and its title song ""Matthew and Son"" both reached top ten in the UK charts. Stevens' albums <i>Tea for the Tillerman</i> (1970) and <i>Teaser and the Firecat</i> (1971) were certified triple platinum in the US.  His 1972 album <i>Catch Bull at Four</i> went to No.1 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 and spent weeks at the top of several other major charts. He earned ASCAP songwriting awards in 2005 and 2006 for ""The First Cut Is the Deepest"", which has been a hit for four artists. His other hit songs include ""Father and Son"", ""Wild World"", ""Moonshadow"", ""Peace Train"", and ""Morning Has Broken"".
</p><p>Stevens converted to Islam in December 1977, and adopted the name Yusuf Islam the following year. In 1979, he auctioned all of his guitars for charity, and left his musical career to devote himself to educational and philanthropic causes in the Muslim community. He has since bought back at least one of these guitars as a result of the efforts of his son Yoriyos. He was embroiled in a long-running controversy regarding comments he made in 1989, about the death fatwa placed on author Salman Rushdie in response to the publication of Rushdie's novel <i>The Satanic Verses</i>. His current stance is that he never supported the fatwa: ""I was cleverly framed by certain questions. I never supported the fatwa."" He has received two honorary doctorates and awards for promoting peace as well as other humanitarian awards.
</p><p>In 2006, he returned to pop music by releasing his first new studio album of new pop songs in 28 years, entitled <i>An Other Cup</i>. With that release and subsequent ones, he dropped the surname ""Islam"" from the album cover art – using the stage name Yusuf as a mononym. In 2009, he released the album <i>Roadsinger</i> and, in 2014, he released the album <i>Tell 'Em I'm Gone</i> and began his first US tour since 1978.  His second North American tour since his resurgence, featuring 12 shows in intimate venues, ran from 12 September to 7 October 2016. In 2017, he released the album <i>The Laughing Apple</i>, now using the stage name Yusuf / Cat Stevens, using the Cat Stevens name for the first time in 39 years. In September 2020, he released <i>Tea for the Tillerman 2</i>, a reimagining of his classic album <i>Tea for the Tillerman</i> to celebrate its 50th anniversary.

</p>
<p><b>Genesis</b>  are an English rock band formed at Charterhouse School, Godalming, Surrey, in 1967. The band's most commercially successful line-up consisted of keyboardist Tony Banks, bassist/guitarist Mike Rutherford and drummer/singer Phil Collins. In the 1970s, during which the band also included singer Peter Gabriel and guitarist Steve Hackett, Genesis were among the pioneers of progressive rock.
</p><p>The group were formed by five Charterhouse pupils, including Banks, Rutherford, Gabriel, and Anthony Phillips, and named by former Charterhouse pupil Jonathan King, who arranged for them to record several singles and their debut album <i>From Genesis to Revelation</i> in 1968. After splitting from King, the band began touring, signed with Charisma Records and became a progressive rock band on <i>Trespass</i> (1970). Following Phillips' departure, Genesis recruited Collins and Hackett and recorded <i>Nursery Cryme</i> (1971). Their live shows began to feature Gabriel's theatrical costumes and performances. <i>Foxtrot</i> (1972) was their first hit in the UK and <i>Selling England by the Pound</i> (1973) reached number three there, featuring their first UK hit ""I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)"". The concept album <i>The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway</i> (1974) was promoted with a transatlantic tour and an elaborate stage show, before Gabriel left the group.
</p><p>Collins took over as lead singer, and the group released <i>A Trick of the Tail</i> and <i>Wind &amp; Wuthering</i> (both 1976) with continued success. Hackett left Genesis in 1977, reducing the band to Banks, Rutherford, and Collins. Their ninth studio album, <i>...And Then There Were Three...</i> (1978), contained the band's first major hit ""Follow You Follow Me"". Their next five albums – <i>Duke</i> (1980), <i>Abacab</i> (1981), <i>Genesis</i> (1983), <i>Invisible Touch</i> (1986) and <i>We Can't Dance</i> (1991) – were also successful. Collins left Genesis in 1996, and Banks and Rutherford replaced him with Ray Wilson, who appeared on their final album <i>Calling All Stations</i> (1997). The commercial failure of the album led to a group hiatus. Banks, Rutherford and Collins reunited for the Turn It On Again Tour in 2007, and again in 2021 for The Last Domino? Tour.
</p><p>With between 100 million and 150 million albums sold worldwide, Genesis are one of the world's best-selling music artists. Their discography includes 15 studio and six live albums. They have won numerous awards (including a Grammy Award for Best Concept Music Video with ""Land of Confusion"") and have inspired a number of tribute bands recreating Genesis shows from various stages of the band's career. In 2010, Genesis were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

</p>
<p><b>Foreigner</b> is a British-American rock band, originally formed in New York City in 1976 by veteran British guitarist and songwriter Mick Jones and fellow Briton and ex-King Crimson member Ian McDonald, along with American vocalist Lou Gramm. Jones came up with the band's name as he, McDonald and Dennis Elliott were British, whereas Gramm, Al Greenwood and Ed Gagliardi were American.</p><p>In 1977, Foreigner released its self-titled debut album, the first of four straight albums to be certified at least 5× platinum in the US. <i>Foreigner</i> peaked at No. 4 on the US album chart and in the top 10 in Canada and Australia, while yielding two top 10 hits in North America, ""Feels Like the First Time"" and ""Cold as Ice"". Their 1978 follow-up, <i>Double Vision</i>, was even more successful peaking at No. 3 in North America with two hit singles, ""Hot Blooded"" a No. 3 hit in both countries, and the title track, a US No. 2 and a Canadian No. 7. Foreigner's third album, <i>Head Games</i> (1979), went to No. 5 in North America producing two top 20 singles, including its title track.
</p><p>Reduced to a quartet, their album <i>4</i> (1981) hit No. 1 (for 10 weeks) in the US and No. 2 in Canada, while becoming Foreigner's break-through album outside of North America, going top 5 in the UK, Germany and Australia. Three of <i>4's</i> singles were hits:  ""Urgent"" reached No. 1 in Canada and on the new US Rock Tracks chart, rose to No. 4 on the US Hot 100 and became their first top 15 hit in Germany; the ballad ""Waiting for a Girl Like You"" peaked at No. 2 in both the US (for a record 10 weeks) and Canada, topped the US Rock Tracks chart and became their first top 10 hit in the UK and Australia; and ""Juke Box Hero"" reached No. 3 on the Rock Tracks chart and the top 30 on the Hot 100. In 1982, Foreigner released its first greatest hits album, <i>Records</i>, which has gone on to sell 7 million copies in the US. In 1984, Foreigner had its biggest hit single, the anthemic ballad ""I Want to Know What Love Is"", which topped the US, UK, Canadian and Australian charts, while hitting No. 3 in Germany and the top 10 in numerous other countries. Its source album, <i>Agent Provocateur</i>, was the band's most successful in the UK, Germany and some other countries in Europe, where it peaked at No. 1, and in Australia where it peaked at No. 3, while making the top 5 in the US and Canada.
</p><p>After a break, Foreigner released <i>Inside Information</i> (1987), which despite the No. 6 US and Australian hit, ""Say You Will"" (which also rose to No. 1 on the US Rock Tracks chart) and the No. 5 US hit, ""I Don't Want to Live Without You"" (which also reached No. 1 on the US Adult Contemporary chart), had a large sales drop-off, only hitting the top 10 in a few European countries with a No. 15 peak in the US. The band's most recent albums, <i>Unusual Heat</i> (1991), without Gramm, who departed due to the band's shift towards the use of synthesizers, <i>Mr. Moonlight</i> (1994), with Gramm back on vocals, and <i>Can't Slow Down</i> (2009), once again without Gramm, were not major sellers; the highest chart positions were obtained in Germany, where the last album peaked at No. 16. Foreigner is one of the world's best-selling bands of all time with worldwide sales of more than 80 million records, including 37.5 million in the US. Leader Mick Jones has been for many years the only founding member still involved.

</p>
<p><b>Animal Collective</b> is an American experimental pop band formed in Baltimore, Maryland. Its members consist of Avey Tare (David Portner), Panda Bear (Noah Lennox), Geologist (Brian Weitz), and Deakin (Josh Dibb). The band's work is characterized by an eclectic exploration of styles, including psychedelia, freak folk, noise, and electronica, with the use of elements such as loops, drones, sampling, vocal harmonies, and sound collage. AllMusic's Fred Thomas suggests that the group ""defined the face of independent experimental rock during the 2000s and 2010s.""</p><p>The band members met in school and started recording together in various forms of collaboration from a young age. In 1999, they established the record label Paw Tracks, issuing what is now considered their debut album, <i>Spirit They're Gone, Spirit They've Vanished</i> (2000), as well as work by other artists. The band's 2007 album <i>Strawberry Jam</i> was their first to chart on the <i>Billboard</i> 200. Their 2009 follow-up <i>Merriweather Post Pavilion</i> was the band's most commercially successful album, reaching #13 on the US chart; its reverb-heavy psychedelic pop sound proved highly influential to independent music of the subsequent decade.</p><p>Records released under the name ""Animal Collective"" may include contributions from any or all of its members. Evolving from early collaborations between Lennox and Portner, the collective was not officially established until all four members came together for the album <i>Here Comes the Indian</i> (2003). Most prior collaborations between the band members were then retroactively classified under Animal Collective's discography. In the case of Dibb, who often takes breaks from recording and performing with the band, his time off does not constitute full leave.</p>

</p>
<p><b>George Harrison</b>  (25 February 1943 – 29 November 2001) was an English musician and singer-songwriter who achieved international fame as the lead guitarist of the Beatles. Sometimes called ""the quiet Beatle"", Harrison embraced Indian culture and helped broaden the scope of popular music through his incorporation of Indian instrumentation and Hindu-aligned spirituality in the Beatles' work. Although the majority of the band's songs were written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contained at least two Harrison compositions. His songs for the group include ""Taxman"", ""Within You Without You"", ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"", ""Here Comes the Sun"" and ""Something"".
</p><p>Harrison's earliest musical influences included George Formby and Django Reinhardt; Carl Perkins, Chet Atkins and Chuck Berry were subsequent influences. By 1965, he had begun to lead the Beatles into folk rock through his interest in Bob Dylan and the Byrds, and towards Indian classical music through his use of Indian instruments, such as sitar, which he had become acquainted with on the set of the movie <i>Help!</i> He played the sitar on numerous Beatles songs, starting with ""Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)"". Having initiated the band's embracing of Transcendental Meditation in 1967, he subsequently developed an association with the Hare Krishna movement. After the band's break-up in 1970, Harrison released the triple album <i>All Things Must Pass</i>, a critically acclaimed work that produced his most successful hit single, ""My Sweet Lord"", and introduced his signature sound as a solo artist, the slide guitar. He also organised the 1971 Concert for Bangladesh with Indian musician Ravi Shankar, a precursor to later benefit concerts such as Live Aid. In his role as a music and film producer, Harrison produced acts signed to the Beatles' Apple record label before founding Dark Horse Records in 1974; he co-founded HandMade Films in 1978, initially to produce the Monty Python troupe's comedy film <i>The Life of Brian</i> (1979).
</p><p>Harrison released several best-selling singles and albums as a solo performer. In 1988, he co-founded the platinum-selling supergroup the Traveling Wilburys. A prolific recording artist, he was featured as a guest guitarist on tracks by Badfinger, Ronnie Wood and Billy Preston, and collaborated on songs and music with Dylan, Eric Clapton, Ringo Starr and Tom Petty, among others. <i>Rolling Stone</i> magazine ranked him number 11 in their list of the ""100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time"". He is a two-time Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee – as a member of the Beatles in 1988, and posthumously for his solo career in 2004.</p><p>Harrison's first marriage, to model Pattie Boyd in 1966, ended in divorce in 1977. The following year he married Olivia Arias, with whom he had a son, Dhani. Harrison died from lung cancer in 2001 at the age of 58, two years after surviving a knife attack by an intruder at his home, Friar Park. His remains were cremated, and the ashes were scattered according to Hindu tradition in a private ceremony in the Ganges and Yamuna rivers in India. He left an estate of almost £100 million.

<p><b>Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds</b> are an Australian rock band formed in 1983 by vocalist Nick Cave, multi-instrumentalist Mick Harvey and guitarist-vocalist Blixa Bargeld. The band has featured international personnel throughout its career and presently consists of Cave, violinist and multi-instrumentalist Warren Ellis, bassist Martyn P. Casey (all from Australia), guitarist George Vjestica (United Kingdom), keyboardist/percussionist Toby Dammit (United States) and drummers Thomas Wydler (Switzerland) and Jim Sclavunos (United States). Described as ""one of the most original and celebrated bands of the post-punk and alternative rock eras in the '80s and onward"", they have released seventeen studio albums and completed numerous international tours.
</p><p>The band was founded following the demise of Cave and Harvey's former group the Birthday Party, the members of which met at a boarding school in Melbourne. Throughout the 1980s, beginning with their debut LP <i>From Her to Eternity</i> (1984), the band drew largely on post-punk, blues and gothic rock, and brought in musicians such as Blixa Bargeld, Barry Adamson and Kid Congo Powers. The band later softened their sound and incorporated other influences on albums such as <i>The Good Son</i> (1990) and <i>The Boatman's Call</i> (1997). Following Harvey's departure in 2009, the band broadened their sound further to include electronic and ambient styles, which feature prominently on the trilogy of albums <i>Push the Sky Away</i> (2013), <i>Skeleton Tree</i> (2016) and <i>Ghosteen</i> (2019).

</p>
<p><b>Janet Damita Jo Jackson</b> (born May 16, 1966) is an American singer, songwriter, actress, and dancer. She is noted for her innovative, socially conscious and sexually provocative records, as well as elaborate stage shows. Her sound and choreography became a catalyst in the growth of MTV, enabling her to rise to prominence while breaking gender and racial barriers in the process. Lyrical content which focused on social issues and lived experiences set her reputation as a role model for youth.
</p><p>The tenth and youngest child of the Jackson family, she made her debut at the MGM Grand. She starred in the variety television series <i>The Jacksons</i> in 1976 and went on to appear in other television shows throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, including <i>Good Times</i>, <i>Diff'rent Strokes</i>, and <i>Fame</i>. After signing a recording contract with A&amp;M Records in 1982, she became a pop icon following the release of her third and fourth studio albums <i>Control</i> (1986) and <i>Rhythm Nation 1814</i> (1989). Her collaborations with record producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis incorporated elements of rhythm and blues, funk, disco, rap, and industrial beats, which led to crossover success in popular music.
</p><p>In 1991, Jackson signed the first of two record-breaking multimillion-dollar contracts with Virgin Records, establishing her as one of the highest-paid artists in the industry. Prior to her first studio project with Virgin, she appeared in her first of several lead film roles in <i>Poetic Justice</i> (1993). Her two studio albums which followed, <i>Janet</i> (1993) and <i>The Velvet Rope</i> (1997), saw her develop a public image as a sex symbol. These records, along with their promotional music videos and live performances in concert tours, branded Jackson as one of the world's most erotic performers, garnering both criticism and praise. By the end of the 1990s, she was named by <i>Billboard</i> magazine as the second most successful recording artist of the decade in the United States after Mariah Carey. The release of her seventh studio album <i>All for You</i> in 2001 coincided with a celebration of her impact on the recording industry as the subject of the inaugural <i>MTV Icon</i> special.</p><p>The backlash from the 2004 Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy resulted in an industry blacklisting under the direction of Les Moonves, then-CEO of CBS Corporation. Jackson subsequently experienced reduced radio airplay, televised promotion and sales figures from that point forward. After parting ways with Virgin Records, she released her tenth studio album <i>Discipline</i> (2008), her first and only album with Island Records. In 2015, she partnered with BMG Rights Management to launch her own record label, Rhythm Nation and released her eleventh studio album <i>Unbreakable</i> the same year. Since then she has continued to release music as an independent artist.
</p><p>Jackson has sold over 100 million records, making her one of the world's best-selling music artists. She has amassed an extensive catalog, with singles such as ""Nasty"", ""Rhythm Nation"", ""That's the Way Love Goes"", ""Together Again"", and ""All for You""; she holds the record for the most consecutive top-ten entries on the US <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 singles chart by a female artist with 18. She is also the only artist in the history of the chart to have seven commercial singles from one album (<i>Rhythm Nation 1814</i>) peak within the top five positions. In 2008, <i>Billboard</i> placed her number seven on its list of the Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists, and in 2010 ranked her fifth among the ""Top 50 R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Artists of the Past 25 Years"". In December 2016, the magazine named her the second most successful dance club artist after Madonna. One of the world's most awarded artists, her accolades include five Grammy Awards, eleven <i>Billboard</i> Music Awards, eleven American Music Awards, a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and eight <i>Guinness World Records</i> entries. In 2019, she was inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.</p>",

</p>
<p><b>Neutral Milk Hotel</b> was an American band formed in Ruston, Louisiana, by musician Jeff Mangum. They were active from 1989 to 1998, and then, from 2013 to 2015. The band's music featured a deliberately low-quality sound, influenced by indie rock and psychedelic folk. Mangum wrote surreal and opaque lyrics that covered a wide range of topics, including love, spirituality, nostalgia, sex, and loneliness. He and the other band members played a variety of instruments, including non-traditional rock instruments like the singing saw, uilleann pipes, and Digital Horn.
</p><p>Neutral Milk Hotel began as one of Mangum's home recording projects. In 1994, he released the song ""Everything Is"" on Cher Doll Records. The song's exposure convinced him to record more music under this name. In 1996, he worked with childhood friend Robert Schneider to record the album <i>On Avery Island</i>, which received modest reviews and sold around 5,000 copies. Mangum recruited musicians Julian Koster, Jeremy Barnes, and Scott Spillane for the band's second album, <i>In the Aeroplane Over the Sea</i>. Its 1998 release received mostly positive, but not laudatory reviews.
</p><p>While on tour, the band's popularity grew through Internet exposure. This negatively affected Mangum, whose mental health began to deteriorate; he did not want to continue touring and Neutral Milk Hotel went on hiatus shortly after. During their hiatus, Neutral Milk Hotel gained a cult following and the critical standing of <i>In the Aeroplane Over the Sea</i> rose tremendously. Several music outlets such as <i>Pitchfork</i> and <i>Blender</i> called <i>In the Aeroplane Over the Sea</i> a landmark album for indie rock and one of the greatest albums of the 1990s. Many indie rock groups such as Arcade Fire and the Decemberists were influenced by Neutral Milk Hotel's eclectic music and earnest lyrics. Neutral Milk Hotel reunited in 2013 and undertook a reunion tour before another hiatus in 2015.

</p>
<p><b>The Temptations</b> are an American vocal group from Detroit, Michigan, who released a series of successful singles and albums with Motown Records during the 1960s and 1970s. The group's work with producer Norman Whitfield, beginning with the Top 10 hit single ""Cloud Nine"" in October 1968, pioneered psychedelic soul, and was significant in the evolution of R&amp;B and soul music. The band members are known for their choreography, distinct harmonies, and dress style. Having sold tens of millions of albums, the Temptations are among the most successful groups in popular music.</p><p>Featuring five male vocalists and dancers (save for brief periods with fewer or more members), the group formed in 1960 in Detroit under the name <i>the Elgins</i>. The founding members came from two rival Detroit vocal groups: Otis Williams, Elbridge ""Al"" Bryant, and Melvin Franklin of Otis Williams &amp; the Distants, and Eddie Kendricks and Paul Williams of the Primes. In 1964, Bryant was replaced by David Ruffin, who was the lead vocalist on a number of the group's biggest hits, including ""My Girl"" (1964), ""Ain't Too Proud to Beg"" (1966), and ""I Wish It Would Rain"" (1967). Ruffin was replaced in 1968 by Dennis Edwards, with whom the group continued to record hit records such as ""Cloud Nine"" (1968), ""I Can't Get Next to You"" (1969), and ""Ball of Confusion (That's What the World Is Today)"" (1970). The group's lineup has changed frequently since the departures of Kendricks and Paul Williams from the act in 1971. Later members of the group have included singers such as Richard Street, Damon Harris, Ron Tyson, and Ali-Ollie Woodson, with whom the group scored a late-period hit in 1984 with ""Treat Her Like a Lady"" and in 1987 with the theme song for the children's movement program <i>Kids in Motion.</i>
</p><p>Over the course of their career, the Temptations released four <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 number-one singles and fourteen R&amp;B number-one singles. Their music has earned three Grammy Awards. The Temptations were the first Motown recording act to win a Grammy Award – for ""Cloud Nine"" in 1969 – and in 2013 received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. Six of the Temptations (Edwards, Franklin, Kendricks, Ruffin, Otis Williams and Paul Williams) were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989. Three classic Temptations songs, ""My Girl"", ""Just My Imagination (Running Away with Me)"", and ""Papa Was a Rollin' Stone"", are among The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll. The Temptations were ranked at number 68 on <i>Rolling Stone</i> magazine's list of the 100 Greatest Artists of all time. The also known to be the first Motown artist to Grammy Award and to get a Lifetime Achievement Award in the year of 2014.</p><p>As of 2022, the Temptations continue to perform with founder Otis Williams in the lineup (Williams owns the rights to the Temptations name).

<p>The <b>Spice Girls</b> are an English girl group formed in 1994, consisting of Melanie Brown, also known as Mel B (""Scary Spice""); Melanie Chisholm, or Melanie C (""Sporty Spice""); Emma Bunton (""Baby Spice""); Geri Halliwell (""Ginger Spice""); and Victoria Beckham (""Posh Spice""). With their ""girl power"" mantra, they redefined the girl-group concept by targeting a young female fanbase. They led the teen pop resurgence of the 1990s, were a major part of the Cool Britannia era, and became pop culture icons of the decade.</p><p>The Spice Girls formed through auditions held with the intent to create a girl group to compete with the British boy bands popular at the time. They quickly left the managers and took creative control over their sound and image. The Spice Girls signed to Virgin Records and released their debut single ""Wannabe"" in 1996, which reached number one on the charts of 37 countries. Their debut album, <i>Spice</i> (1996), sold more than 23 million copies worldwide, becoming the best-selling album by a female group in history. It produced three more number-one singles: ""Say You'll Be There"", ""2 Become 1"" and ""Who Do You Think You Are""/""Mama"". Their second album <i>Spiceworld</i> (1997) was another global success, selling more than 14 million copies worldwide. They achieved three number-one singles from the album with: ""Spice Up Your Life"", ""Too Much"" and ""Viva Forever"". Both albums encapsulated the group's dance-pop style and message of female empowerment, with vocal and songwriting contributions shared equally by the members. 
</p><p>In 1997 the Spice Girls made their live debut concert tour and starred in their own film based on themselves called <i>Spice World</i>, both to commercial success. In early 1998 the group embarked on their Spiceworld Tour, which was attended by an estimated 2.1 million people worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing concert tour by a female group, grossing an estimated $220–250 million in ticket sales. Halliwell left the Spice Girls mid-tour in May 1998. Following a number-one single with ""Goodbye"" (1998) and a successful 1999 concert tour, the Spice Girls released their R&amp;B-influenced third album <i>Forever</i> (2000). It featured their ninth number one single with ""Holler""/""Let Love Lead the Way"", setting a record for most UK number ones by a girl group of all time. At the end of 2000, the Spice Girls entered a hiatus to concentrate on their solo careers. Since then, they reunited for two concert tours; the Return of the Spice Girls (2007–2008) as a five-piece and Spice World – 2019 tour without Beckham, both of which won the <i>Billboard</i> Live Music Award for highest-grossing engagements, making the Spice Girls the top touring all-female group from 1998 to 2020. They also reunited briefly in 2012 for a critically acclaimed live performance at the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony.</p><p>The Spice Girls have sold 100 million records worldwide, making them the best-selling girl group of all time, one of the bestselling artists, and the most successful British pop act since the Beatles. They received five Brit Awards, three American Music Awards, four <i>Billboard</i> Music Awards, three MTV Europe Music Awards and one MTV Video Music Award. In 2000, they became the youngest recipients of the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. According to <i>Rolling Stone</i> journalist and biographer David Sinclair, they were the most widely recognised group since the Beatles. Other measures of the Spice Girls' success include iconic symbolism such as Halliwell's Union Jack dress, and their nicknames, which were given to them by the British press. Under the guidance of their mentor and manager Simon Fuller, their endorsement deals and merchandise made them one of most successful marketing engines ever, with a global gross income estimated at $500–800 million by May 1998. According to the <i>Music Week</i> writer Paul Gorman, their media exposure helped usher in an era of celebrity obsession in pop culture.</p>",London

</p>
<p><b>Billie Holiday</b> (born <b>Eleanora Fagan</b>; April 7, 1915 – July 17, 1959) was an American jazz and swing music singer. Nicknamed ""<b>Lady Day</b>"" by her friend and music partner, Lester Young, Holiday had an innovative influence on jazz music and pop singing. Her vocal style, strongly inspired by jazz instrumentalists, pioneered a new way of manipulating phrasing and tempo. She was known for her vocal delivery and improvisational skills.</p><p>After a turbulent childhood, Holiday began singing in nightclubs in Harlem, where she was heard by producer John Hammond, who liked her voice. She signed a recording contract with Brunswick in 1935. Collaborations with Teddy Wilson produced the hit ""What a Little Moonlight Can Do"", which became a jazz standard. Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, Holiday had mainstream success on labels such as Columbia and Decca. By the late 1940s, however, she was beset with legal troubles and drug abuse. After a short prison sentence, she performed at a sold-out concert at Carnegie Hall.
She was a successful concert performer throughout the 1950s with two further sold-out shows at Carnegie Hall. Because of personal struggles and an altered voice, her final recordings were met with mixed reaction but were mild commercial successes. Her final album, <i>Lady in Satin</i>, was released in 1958. Holiday died of cirrhosis on July 17, 1959, at age 44.
</p><p>Holiday won four Grammy Awards, all of them posthumously, for Best Historical Album. She was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame and the National Rhythm &amp; Blues Hall of Fame. She was also inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame, though not in that genre; the website states that ""Billie Holiday changed jazz forever"". Several films about her life have been released, most recently <i>The United States vs. Billie Holiday</i> (2021).

<p><b>John Towner Williams</b> KBE (born February 8, 1932) is an American composer, conductor, and pianist. In a career that has spanned seven decades, he has composed some of the most popular, recognizable and critically acclaimed film scores in cinematic history. Williams has won 25 Grammy Awards, seven British Academy Film Awards, five Academy Awards, and four Golden Globe Awards. With 53 Academy Award nominations, he is the second most-nominated individual, after Walt Disney. His compositions are considered the epitome of film music, and he is considered among the greatest composers in the history of cinema.</p><p>Williams has composed for many critically acclaimed and popular movies, including the <i>Star Wars</i> saga, <i>Jaws</i>, <i>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</i>, <i>Superman</i>, <i>E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</i>, the first two <i>Home Alone</i> films, the <i>Indiana Jones</i> films, the first two <i>Jurassic Park</i> films, <i>Schindler's List</i>, <i>Saving Private Ryan</i>, <i>Catch Me If You Can</i>, <i>Seven Years In Tibet</i>, and the first three <i>Harry Potter</i> films. Williams has also composed numerous classical concertos and other works for orchestral ensembles and solo instruments. He served as the Boston Pops' principal conductor from 1980 to 1993 and is its laureate conductor. He has been associated with director Steven Spielberg since 1974, composing music for all but five of his feature films, and George Lucas, with whom he has worked on both of his main franchises. Other works by Williams include theme music for the 1984 Summer Olympic Games, <i>NBC Sunday Night Football</i>, ""The Mission"" theme used by NBC News and Seven News in Australia, the television series <i>Lost in Space</i> and <i>Land of the Giants</i>, and the incidental music for the first season of <i>Gilligan's Island</i>. Williams announced his intention to retire from film score composing after the release of <i>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny</i> in 2023 to focus more on composing independent orchestral and symphonic pieces, though he later rescinded this.</p><p>In 2005, the American Film Institute selected Williams's score to 1977's <i>Star Wars</i> as the greatest film score of all time. The Library of Congress entered the <i>Star Wars</i> soundtrack into the National Recording Registry for being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"". Williams was inducted into the Hollywood Bowl's Hall of Fame in 2000, and he received a Kennedy Center Honor in 2004. His AFI Life Achievement Award in 2016 was the first to be awarded outside of the acting and directing fields. He has composed the score for nine of the top 25 highest-grossing films at the U.S. box office (adjusted for inflation). His work has influenced other composers of film, popular, and contemporary classical music; Norwegian composer Marcus Paus argues that Williams's ""satisfying way of embodying dissonance and avant-garde techniques within a larger tonal framework"" makes him ""one of the great composers of any century"".</p>

<p><b>Explosions in the Sky</b> is an American post-rock band from Texas. The quartet originally played under the name Breaker Morant, then changed to the current name in 1999. The band has garnered popularity beyond the post-rock scene for their elaborately developed guitar work, narratively styled instrumentals—what they refer to as ""cathartic mini-symphonies""—and their enthusiastic and emotional live shows. They primarily play with three electric guitars and a drum kit, although band member Michael James will at times exchange his electric guitar for a bass guitar. The band has later added a fifth member to their live performances. The band's music is almost purely instrumental.

<p><b>In Flames</b> is a Swedish heavy metal band, formed by guitarist Jesper Strömblad in Gothenburg in 1990. Alongside At the Gates and Dark Tranquillity, In Flames pioneered the genres known as Swedish death metal and melodic death metal.
</p><p>During the band's early years, In Flames had a varying group of musicians recording with them, including many session musicians. By the release of <i>Colony</i> (1999), the group had established a stable lineup. Their sixth studio album <i>Reroute to Remain</i> (2002) showed the band moving toward a newer style of music that moved further away from melodic death metal and closer to alternative metal. This decision was criticized by fans of the group's heavier metal sound; however, it increased the band's mainstream audience and bolstered their album sales. As of 2008, In Flames has sold over two million records worldwide.</p><p>Since the band's inception, In Flames have released fourteen studio albums, three EPs, and two live DVDs, their latest release being their fourteenth studio album <i>Foregone</i> in 2023. In Flames has been nominated for three Grammis Awards. They won two of these nominations; one for <i>Soundtrack to Your Escape</i> (2004) in the ""Hard Rock/Metal of the Year"" category, and one nomination for their following album <i>Come Clarity</i> (2006) in the same category.

</p>
<p><b>The Stone Roses</b> were an English rock band formed in Manchester in 1983. One of the pioneering groups of the Madchester movement in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the band's classic and most prominent lineup consisted of vocalist Ian Brown, guitarist John Squire, bassist Mani and drummer Reni.
</p><p>The band released their debut album, <i>The Stone Roses</i>, in 1989. The album was a breakthrough success for the band and received critical acclaim, many regarding it as one of the greatest British albums ever recorded. At this time the group decided to capitalise on their success by signing to a major label. Their record label at the time, Silvertone, would not let them out of their contract, which led to a long legal battle that culminated with the band signing with Geffen Records in 1991.
</p><p>The Stone Roses released their second album, <i>Second Coming</i>, in 1994, which received mixed reviews. The group soon disbanded after several line-up changes throughout the supporting tour, which began with Reni departing in early 1995, followed by Squire in April 1996. Brown and Mani dissolved the remains of the group in October 1996 following their appearance at Reading Festival.
</p><p>Following much intensified media speculation, the Stone Roses called a press conference on 18 October 2011 to announce that the band had reunited and would perform a reunion world tour in 2012, including three homecoming shows in Heaton Park, Manchester. Plans to record a third album in the future were also floated but only two singles were released. In June 2012, Chris Coghill, the writer of a new film which is set during the Stone Roses 1990 Spike Island show, revealed that the band ""have at least three or four new tracks recorded"". In June 2013, a documentary about the band's reformation directed by Shane Meadows and titled <i>The Stone Roses: Made of Stone</i> was released.</p><p>In 2016, the Stone Roses released their first new material in two decades. The band members continued to tour until June 2017, at which point cryptic remarks by Brown indicated the band had split again, which was later confirmed in a 2019 interview with Squire.</p>

</p>
<p><b>Third Eye Blind</b> is an American rock band formed in San Francisco, California, in 1993. After years of lineup changes in the early and mid-1990s, the songwriting duo of Stephan Jenkins and Kevin Cadogan signed the band's first major-label recording contract with Elektra Records in 1996. The band released their self-titled debut album in 1997, with the band largely consisting of Jenkins (vocals, rhythm guitar), Cadogan (lead guitar), Arion Salazar (bass guitar), and Brad Hargreaves (drums). Shortly after the release of the band's second album in 1999, <i>Blue</i>, with the same line-up, Cadogan was released from the band under controversial circumstances.
</p><p>The band continued, but with many line-up changes and long gaps between album releases for the next 15 years. The band released <i>Out of the Vein</i> in 2003 and <i>Ursa Major</i> in 2009 with guitarist Tony Fredianelli, but parted ways with him shortly afterwards, leaving only Jenkins and Hargreaves as the remaining core members. The band's lineup stabilized again in the mid-2010s, adding Kryz Reid (lead guitar), Alex Kopp (keyboards), and Alex LeCavalier (bass guitar). The new lineup led to increased output with less time between releases - <i>Dopamine</i> (2015), and a string of EPs, <i>We Are Drugs</i> (2016) and <i>Thanks for Everything</i> (2018). After Kopp was replaced by Colin Creev, a sixth and seventh studio albums <i>Screamer</i> (2019) and <i>Our Bande Apart</i> (2021) were released.
</p><p>The band found commercial success in the late 1990s, with <i>Third Eye Blind</i> and <i>Blue</i> certified platinum six times and single platinum in the United States, respectively.  Several songs were commercial successes as well, with ""Semi-Charmed Life"", ""Jumper"", and ""How's It Going to Be"", all reaching the Top 10 of the US <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100, and ""Never Let You Go"" reaching the Top 20.

<p><b>Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers</b> was an American rock band from Gainesville, Florida. Formed in 1976, the band originally comprised lead singer and rhythm guitarist Tom Petty, lead guitarist Mike Campbell, keyboardist Benmont Tench, drummer Stan Lynch and bassist Ron Blair. In 1982, Blair, weary of the touring lifestyle, departed the band. His replacement, Howie Epstein, stayed with the band for the next two decades. In 1991, Scott Thurston joined the band as a multi-instrumentalist—mostly on rhythm guitar and second keyboard. In 1994, Steve Ferrone replaced Lynch on drums. Blair returned to the Heartbreakers in 2002, the year before Epstein's death. The band had a long string of hit singles including ""Breakdown"", ""American Girl"", ""Refugee"", ""The Waiting"", ""Learning to Fly"", and ""Mary Jane's Last Dance"", among many others, that stretched over several decades of work.
</p><p>The band's music was characterized as both Southern rock and heartland rock, cited alongside artists such as Bruce Springsteen, Bob Seger, and John Mellencamp as progenitors of that genre that arose in the late 1970s and 1980s.  While the heartland rock movement waned in the 1990s, the band remained active and popular, touring regularly until Petty's death in 2017, after which the Heartbreakers disbanded. Their final studio album, <i>Hypnotic Eye</i>, was released in 2014.
</p><p>The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002, their first year of eligibility. Although most of their material was produced and performed under the name ""Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers"", Petty released three solo albums, the most successful of which was <i>Full Moon Fever</i> (1989). In these releases, some members of the band contributed as collaborators, producing and performing as studio musicians.

</p>
<p>The <b>Sex Pistols</b> were an English punk rock band formed in London in 1975. Although their initial career lasted just two and a half years, they were one of the most groundbreaking acts in the history of popular music. They were responsible for initiating the punk movement in the United Kingdom and inspiring many later punk and alternative rock musicians. Their fashion and hairstyles were a significant influence on punk image, and they are often associated with anarchism within music.
</p><p>The Sex Pistols originally comprised vocalist Johnny Rotten (John Lydon), guitarist Steve Jones, drummer Paul Cook, and bassist Glen Matlock; Matlock was replaced by Sid Vicious in early 1977. Under the management of Malcolm McLaren, the band attracted some controversies that both captivated and appalled Britain. Through an obscenity-laced television interview in December 1976 and their May 1977 single ""God Save the Queen"", the latter of which attacked Britons' social conformity and deference to the Crown, calling the monarchy a ""fascist regime"". The release of the song popularised punk rock in the UK. ""God Save the Queen"" was banned by the BBC and nearly every independent radio station in Britain, making it one of the most censored records in British history.
</p><p>The Sex Pistols' only album, <i>Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols</i> (1977) — a UK number one — is a staple record of punk rock. In January 1978, at the end of their turbulent tour of the US, Rotten announced the band's break-up. Over the next few months, the three remaining members recorded songs for McLaren's film of the Sex Pistols' story, <i>The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle</i>. Vicious died of a heroin overdose in February 1979, following his arrest for the alleged murder of his girlfriend, Nancy Spungen. A film about the couple, <i>Sid and Nancy</i>, was released in 1986. Rotten, Jones, Cook, and Matlock reunited for a successful tour in 1996. Further one-off performances and short tours followed over the next decade.
</p><p>The Sex Pistols have been recognised as an influential band. In 2004, <i>Rolling Stone</i> placed them No. 58 on its list of the ""100 Greatest Artists of All Time"". On 24 February 2006, the Sex Pistols—the four original members plus Vicious—were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame; they refused to attend the ceremony, calling it ""a piss stain"".</p>

Acting on the advice of the managing director of their record label, the two joined to record ""Neverending Love"", which became a hit single in Sweden.
</p><p>After the release of <i>Don't Bore Us, Get to the Chorus!,</i> a greatest hits record, the duo took a hiatus before returning with the albums <i>Have a Nice Day</i> (1999) and <i>Room Service</i> (2001). They continued to chart in other territories, mainly in Europe, Australia and Latin America, where they earned various Gold and Platinum awards until the beginning of the new millennium. In 2002, the duo took a break from recording and touring when Fredriksson was diagnosed with a brain tumour. Gessle went on to release solo albums and reunited with Gyllene Tider before Roxette took to the stage together again for the first time in eight years, in 2009, during Gessle's European <i>Party Crasher</i> tour. In 2011, they released <i>Charm School</i>, their first studio album in ten years, which was followed by <i>Travelling</i> in 2012. Their final studio album, <i>Good Karma</i>, was released in 2016. Marie Fredriksson died on 9 December 2019, at the age of 61, following a long battle with a brain tumour.
</p><p>Their songs ""It Must Have Been Love"" and ""Listen to Your Heart"" continue to receive wide radio airplay, with both singles receiving awards from BMI in 2014 for achieving five million radio plays. They have sold an estimated 75 million records worldwide, with over 10 million in certified units from Germany, the US and the UK, achieving gold and platinum certifications for <i>Joyride</i> and <i>Look Sharp!</i> in all three regions. They are Sweden's second-best-selling music act after ABBA.</p>

</p>
<p><b>Pulp</b> are an English rock band formed in Sheffield in 1978. Their best-known line-up from their heyday (1992–1997) consisted of Jarvis Cocker (vocals, guitar, keyboards), Russell Senior (guitar, violin), Candida Doyle (keyboards), Nick Banks (drums, percussion), Steve Mackey (bass) and Mark Webber (guitar, keyboards).
</p><p>Throughout the 1980s the band struggled to find success, but gained prominence in the UK in the mid-1990s with the release of the albums <i>His 'n' Hers</i> in 1994 and particularly <i>Different Class</i> in 1995, which reached the number one spot in the UK Albums Chart. The album spawned four top ten singles, including ""Common People"" and ""Sorted for E's &amp; Wizz"", both of which reached number two in the UK Singles Chart. Pulp's musical style during this period consisted of disco-influenced pop-rock coupled with references to British culture in their lyrics in the form of a ""kitchen sink drama""-style. Cocker and the band became reluctant figureheads of the Britpop movement, and were nominated for the Mercury Music Prize in 1994 for <i>His 'n' Hers</i>; they won the prize in 1996 for <i>Different Class</i> and were nominated again in 1998 for <i>This Is Hardcore</i>. Pulp headlined the Pyramid Stage of the Glastonbury Festival twice and were regarded among the Britpop ""big four"", along with Oasis, Blur and Suede.</p><p>The band released <i>We Love Life</i> in 2001 and then took a decade-long break, having sold more than 10 million records. Pulp reunited and played live again in 2011, with dates at the Isle of Wight Festival, Reading and Leeds Festivals, Pohoda, Sziget Festival, Primavera Sound, the Exit festival, and the Wireless Festival. A number of additional concert dates were afterward added to their schedule. In January 2013, Pulp released ""After You"", a song originally demoed for <i>We Love Life</i>, as a digital download single. It was the band's first single release since ""Bad Cover Version"" in 2002. On 9 March 2014, Pulp and filmmaker Florian Habicht premiered the feature documentary <i>Pulp: A Film about Life, Death &amp; Supermarkets</i> at SXSW Music and Film Festival in Austin, Texas. The film toured the international film festival circuit and was released theatrically by  Oscilloscope Laboratories in the US in November 2014. It is the first film about Pulp (and Sheffield) that has been made in collaboration with the band. The band once again went on hiatus following this, but in 2022, Cocker announced that the band would be reuniting for a second time to play a series of shows in 2023.</p>

</p>
<p><b>Whitesnake</b> are  an English hard rock band formed in London in 1978. The group was originally put together as the backing band for singer David Coverdale, who had recently left Deep Purple. Though the band quickly developed into their own entity, Coverdale is the only constant member throughout their history.
</p><p>Whitesnake enjoyed much success in the UK, Europe and Japan through their early years. Their albums <i>Ready an' Willing</i>, <i>Come an' Get It</i> and <i>Saints &amp; Sinners</i> all reached the top ten on the UK Albums Chart. By the mid-1980s, however, Coverdale had set his sights on breaking through in North America, where Whitesnake remained largely unknown. With the backing of American label Geffen Records, Whitesnake released <i>Slide It In</i> in 1984, followed by an eponymous album in 1987, which became their biggest success to date, selling over eight million copies in the US and spawning the hit singles ""Here I Go Again"" and ""Is This Love"". 
</p><p>Whitesnake also adopted a more contemporary look, akin to the Los Angeles glam metal scene. After releasing <i>Slip of the Tongue</i> in 1989, Coverdale decided to put Whitesnake on hold to take a break from the music industry. Aside from a few short-lived reunions in the 1990s, Whitesnake remained mostly inactive until 2003, when Coverdale put together a new line-up to celebrate the band's 25th anniversary. Since then Whitesnake have released four more studio albums and toured extensively around the world.
</p><p>Whitesnake's early sound has been characterized by critics as blues rock, but by the mid-1980s the band slowly began moving toward a more commercially accessible hard rock style. Topics such as love and sex are common in Whitesnake's lyrics, which have been criticized for their excessive use of sexual innuendos and double entendres. Whitesnake have been nominated for several awards during their career, including Best British Group at the 1988 Brit Awards. They have also been featured on lists of the greatest hard rock bands of all time by several media outlets, while their songs and albums have appeared on many ""best of"" lists by outlets, such as VH1 and <i>Rolling Stone</i>.</p>",London

<p><b>Antonio Lucio Vivaldi</b> (4 March 1678 – 28 July 1741) was a Venetian composer, virtuoso violinist and impresario of Baroque music. Along with Johan Sebastian Bach and Georg Frideric Handel, Vivaldi is regarded as one of the greatest Baroque composers and his influence during his lifetime was widespread across Europe, giving origin to many imitators and admirers. He pioneered many developments in orchestration, violin technique and programatic music. He consolidated the emerging concerto form into a widely accepted and followed idiom, which was paramount in the development of Johann Sebastian Bach's instrumental music.
</p><p>Vivaldi composed many instrumental concertos, for the violin and a variety of other musical instruments, as well as sacred choral works and more than fifty operas. His best-known work is a series of violin concertos known as <i>the Four Seasons</i>. Many of his compositions were written for the all-female music ensemble of the <i>Ospedale della Pietà</i>, a home for abandoned children. Vivaldi began studying for the priesthood at the age of 15 and was ordained at 25, but was given dispensation to no longer say public Masses due to a health problem. Vivaldi also had some success with expensive stagings of his operas in Venice, Mantua and Vienna. After meeting the Emperor Charles VI, Vivaldi moved to Vienna, hoping for royal support. However, the Emperor died soon after Vivaldi's arrival, and Vivaldi himself died in poverty less than a year later.  
</p><p>After almost two centuries of decline, Vivaldi's musical reputation underwent a revival in the early 20th century, with much scholarly research devoted to his work. Many of Vivaldi's compositions, once thought lost, have been rediscovered – in one case as recently as 2006. His music remains widely popular in the present day and is regularly played all over the world.

</p>
<p><b>Bad Religion</b> is an American punk rock band that formed in Los Angeles, California, in 1980. The band's lyrics cover topics related to religion, politics, society, the media and science. Musically, they are noted for their melodic sensibilities and extensive use of three-part vocal harmonies. The band has experienced multiple line-up changes, with singer Greg Graffin being the band's only constant member, though fellow founding members Jay Bentley and Brett Gurewitz have also been with the band for most of their history while guitarist Brian Baker has been a member of the group since 1994. Guitarist Mike Dimkich and drummer Jamie Miller have been members of the band since 2013 and 2015 respectively. To date, Bad Religion has released seventeen studio albums, two live albums, three compilation albums, three EPs, and two live DVDs. They are considered to be one of the best-selling punk rock acts of all time, having sold over five million albums worldwide.</p><p>After gaining a large underground following and critical praise through their releases on Gurewitz's label Epitaph in the 1980s and early 1990s, Bad Religion experienced mainstream success after signing to the major label Atlantic in 1993. Bad Religion pioneered the punk rock revival movement of the 1990s, establishing a formula for California-based punk bands such as Green Day and Epitaph-signed acts the Offspring, NOFX and Rancid. Atlantic reissued the previously-released-on-Epitaph album, <i>Recipe for Hate</i> (1993), which became commercially successful, as did its 1994 follow-up <i>Stranger than Fiction</i>. <i>Stranger than Fiction</i> included some of Bad Religion's well-known hits, including ""Infected,"" ""Stranger than Fiction,"" and the re-recorded version of ""21st Century (Digital Boy)""; the album was later certified gold in both the United States and Canada.
</p><p>Shortly before the release of <i>Stranger than Fiction,</i> Gurewitz left Bad Religion to run his label Epitaph on a full-time basis, and was replaced by Brian Baker. The band's success had slowly dwindled by the late 1990s, and, after three more albums, they were dropped from Atlantic in 2001. This resulted in Bad Religion returning to Epitaph and Gurewitz rejoining the band. Since then, they have undergone a resurgence in popularity, with ""Sorrow,"" ""Los Angeles Is Burning,"" and ""The Devil in Stitches"" being Top 40 hits on the US charts while their sixteenth studio album, <i>True North</i> (2013), became Bad Religion's first album to crack the top 20 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 chart where it peaked at number 19. The band's seventeenth and most recent studio album, <i>Age of Unreason,</i> was released on May 3, 2019.</p>",Los Angeles

</p>
<p><b>Rush</b> was a Canadian rock band that was comprised primarily of Geddy Lee (bass, vocals), Alex Lifeson (guitar), and Neil Peart (drums, percussion, lyricist). The band was formed in Toronto in 1968 by Lifeson, drummer John Rutsey, and bass guitarist/vocalist Jeff Jones, who was immediately replaced by Lee. After Lee joined, the band went through several line-up configurations before arriving at its classic power trio line-up with the addition of Peart in July 1974, who replaced Rutsey four months after the release of their self-titled debut album; this line-up remained intact for the remainder of the band's career.
</p><p>Rush achieved commercial success in the 1970s with <i>Fly by Night</i> (1975), <i>2112</i> (1976), <i>A Farewell to Kings</i> (1977) and <i>Hemispheres</i> (1978). The band's popularity continued throughout the 1980s and 1990s, with albums charting highly in Canada, the US and the UK, including <i>Permanent Waves</i> (1980), <i>Moving Pictures</i> (1981), <i>Signals</i> (1982), <i>Grace Under Pressure</i> (1984) and <i>Counterparts</i> (1993). Rush continued to record and perform until 1997, after which the band entered a four-year hiatus due to personal tragedies in Peart's life. The trio regrouped in 2001 and released three more studio albums: <i>Vapor Trails</i> (2002), <i>Snakes &amp; Arrows</i> (2007), and <i>Clockwork Angels</i> (2012). Rush ceased touring at the end of 2015, and Lifeson announced in January 2018 that the band would not continue, which was cemented by Peart's death from glioblastoma, a type of brain cancer, on January 7, 2020, at the age of 67.</p><p>Rush were known for their musicianship, complex compositions and eclectic lyrical motifs drawing heavily on science fiction, fantasy and philosophy. The band's style changed over the years, from a blues-inspired hard rock beginning, later moving into progressive rock, then a period in the 1980s marked by heavy use of synthesizers, before returning to guitar-driven hard rock at the end of the 1980s. Their final work from 2012, marked a return to progressive rock. The members of Rush have been acknowledged as some of the most proficient players on their respective instruments, with each winning numerous awards in magazine readers' polls over the years.
</p><p>As of 2022, Rush ranks 84th in the U.S. with sales of 26 million albums and industry sources estimate their total worldwide album sales at over 42 million. Rush has been awarded 14 platinum and 3 multi-platinum albums in the US plus 17 platinum albums in Canada. Rush was nominated for seven Grammy Awards, won several Juno Awards, and won an International Achievement Award at the 2009 SOCAN Awards. The band was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 1994 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2013.</p>",Toronto

<p><b>John Robert</b> ""<b>Joe</b>"" <b>Cocker</b>  (20 May 1944 – 22 December 2014) was an English singer known for his gritty, bluesy voice and dynamic stage performances that featured expressive body movements.  Most of his best known singles were recordings of songs written by other song writers, though he composed a number of songs for most of his albums as well, often in conjunction with songwriting partner Chris Stainton.</p><p>His first album featured a recording of the Beatles' ""With a Little Help from My Friends"", which brought him to near-instant stardom. The song reached number one in the UK in 1968, became a staple of his many live shows (Woodstock and the Isle of Wight in 1969, the Party at the Palace in 2002) and was also known as the theme song for the late 1980s American TV series <i>The Wonder Years</i>. He continued his success with his second album, which included a second Beatles song: ""She Came In Through the Bathroom Window"". A hastily thrown together 1970 US tour led to the live double-album <i>Mad Dogs &amp; Englishmen</i>, which featured an all-star band organized by Leon Russell.  His 1974 recording of ""You Are So Beautiful"" reached number five in the US, and became his signature song.  Cocker's best selling song was the US number one ""Up Where We Belong"", a duet with Jennifer Warnes that earned a 1983 Grammy Award.  He released a total of 22 studio albums over a 43-year recording career.  
</p><p>In 1993, Cocker was nominated for the Brit Award for Best British Male. He was awarded a bronze Sheffield Legends plaque in his hometown in 2007, and received an OBE the following year for services to music. Cocker was ranked number 97 on <i>Rolling Stone</i><span>'</span>s 100 greatest singers list.</p>",

<p><b>Brian Peter George St John le Baptiste de la Salle Eno</b>  (<span></span>; born <b>Brian Peter George Eno</b>, 15 May 1948) is a British musician, composer, record producer and visual artist best known for his contributions to ambient music and work in rock, pop and electronica. A self-described ""non-musician"", Eno has helped introduce unconventional concepts and approaches to contemporary music. He has been described as one of popular music's most influential and innovative figures.</p><p>Born in Suffolk, Eno studied painting and experimental music at the art school of Ipswich Civic College in the mid 1960s, and then at Winchester School of Art. He joined glam rock group Roxy Music as its synthesiser player in 1971, recording two albums with the group before departing in 1973. Eno then released a number of solo pop albums beginning with <i>Here Come the Warm Jets</i> (1974) and, also in the mid-1970s, began exploring a minimalist direction on influential recordings such as <i>Discreet Music</i> (1975) and <i>Ambient 1: Music for Airports</i> (1978), coining the term ""ambient music"" with the latter.
</p><p>Alongside his solo work, Eno collaborated frequently with other musicians in the 1970s, including Robert Fripp, Harmonia, Cluster, Harold Budd, David Bowie, David Byrne and Judy Nylon. He also established himself as a sought-after producer, working on albums by John Cale, Jon Hassell, Laraaji, Talking Heads, Ultravox, and Devo, as well as the no wave compilation <i>No New York</i> (1978). In subsequent decades, Eno continued to record solo albums and produce for other artists, most prominently U2 and Coldplay, alongside work with artists such as Daniel Lanois, Laurie Anderson, Grace Jones, Slowdive, Karl Hyde, James, Kevin Shields, and Damon Albarn.
</p><p>Dating back to his time as a student, Eno has also worked in other media, including sound installations, film, and writing. In the mid-1970s, he co-developed Oblique Strategies, a deck of cards featuring aphorisms intended to spur creative thinking. From the 1970s onwards, Eno's installations have included the sails of the Sydney Opera House in 2009 and the Lovell Telescope at Jodrell Bank in 2016. An advocate of a range of humanitarian causes, Eno writes on a variety of subjects and is a founding member of the Long Now Foundation. In 2019, Eno was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Roxy Music.</p>",

<p><b>Ennio Morricone</b>  (<small>Italian: </small><span title=""Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)"" lang=""it-Latn-fonipa"">[ˈɛnnjo morriˈkoːne]</span>; 10 November 1928 – 6 July 2020) was an Italian composer, orchestrator, conductor, and trumpeter who wrote music in a wide range of styles. With more than 400 scores for cinema and television, as well as more than 100 classical works, Morricone is widely considered one of the most prolific and greatest film composers of all time. His filmography includes more than 70 award-winning films, all Sergio Leone's films since <i>A Fistful of Dollars</i>, all Giuseppe Tornatore's films since <i>Cinema Paradiso</i>, <i>The Battle of Algiers</i>, Dario Argento's <i>Animal Trilogy</i>, <i>1900</i>, <i>Exorcist II</i>, <i>Days of Heaven</i>, several major films in French cinema, in particular the comedy trilogy <i>La Cage aux Folles I</i>, <i>II</i>, <i>III</i> and <i>Le Professionnel</i>, as well as <i>The Thing</i>, <i>Once Upon a Time in America</i>, <i>The Mission</i>, <i>The Untouchables</i>, <i>Mission to Mars</i>, <i>Bugsy</i>, <i>Disclosure</i>, <i>In the Line of Fire</i>, <i>Bulworth</i>, <i>Ripley's Game</i>, and <i>The Hateful Eight</i>. His score to <i>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</i> (1966) is regarded as one of the most recognizable and influential soundtracks in history. It was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.</p><p>After playing the trumpet in jazz bands in the 1940s, he became a studio arranger for RCA Victor and in 1955 started ghost writing for film and theatre. Throughout his career, he composed music for artists such as Paul Anka, Mina, Milva, Zucchero, and Andrea Bocelli. From 1960 to 1975, Morricone gained international fame for composing music for Westerns and—with an estimated 10 million copies sold—<i>Once Upon a Time in the West</i> is one of the best-selling scores worldwide. From 1966 to 1980, he was a main member of Il Gruppo, one of the first experimental composers collectives, and in 1969 he co-founded Forum Music Village, a prestigious recording studio. From the 1970s, Morricone excelled in Hollywood, composing for prolific American directors such as Don Siegel, Mike Nichols, Brian De Palma, Barry Levinson, Oliver Stone, Warren Beatty, John Carpenter, and Quentin Tarantino. In 1977, he composed the official theme for the 1978 FIFA World Cup. He continued to compose music for European productions, such as <i>Marco Polo</i>, <i>La piovra</i>, <i>Nostromo</i>, <i>Fateless</i>, <i>Karol</i>, and <i>En mai, fais ce qu'il te plait</i>. Morricone's music has been reused in television series, including <i>The Simpsons</i> and <i>The Sopranos</i>, and in many films, including <i>Inglourious Basterds</i> and <i>Django Unchained</i>. He also scored seven Westerns for Sergio Corbucci, Duccio Tessari's <i>Ringo</i> duology and Sergio Sollima's <i>The Big Gundown</i> and <i>Face to Face</i>. Morricone worked extensively for other film genres with directors such as Bernardo Bertolucci, Mauro Bolognini, Giuliano Montaldo, Roland Joffé, Roman Polanski, Henri Verneuil, Mario Bava, Lucio Fulci, Umberto Lenzi, and Pier Paolo Pasolini. His acclaimed soundtrack for <i>The Mission</i> (1986), was certified gold in the United States. The album <i>Yo-Yo Ma Plays Ennio Morricone</i> stayed for 105 weeks on the <i>Billboard</i> Top Classical Albums.</p><p>Morricone's best-known compositions include ""The Ecstasy of Gold"", ""Se telefonando"", ""Man with a Harmonica"", ""Here's to You"", the UK No. 2 single ""Chi Mai"", ""Gabriel's Oboe"", and ""E Più Ti Penso"". In 1971, he received a ""Targa d'Oro"" for worldwide sales of 22 million, and by 2016 Morricone had sold more than 70 million records worldwide. In 2007, he received the Academy Honorary Award ""for his magnificent and multifaceted contributions to the art of film music"". He was nominated for a further six Oscars, and in 2016, received his only competitive Academy Award for his score to Quentin Tarantino's film <i>The Hateful Eight</i>, at the time becoming the oldest person ever to win a competitive Oscar. His other achievements include three Grammy Awards, three Golden Globes, six BAFTAs, ten David di Donatello, eleven Nastro d'Argento, two European Film Awards, the Golden Lion Honorary Award, and the Polar Music Prize in 2010. Morricone influenced many artists from film scoring to other styles and genres, including Hans Zimmer, Danger Mouse, Dire Straits, Muse, Metallica, Fields of the Nephilim, and Radiohead.</p>

Records' radio promotion department to push his singles. Their second single, ""Can't Hold Us"", also peaked at number one on the Hot 100 Chart, making Macklemore and Lewis the first duo in the chart's history to have their first two singles both reach the peak position. Macklemore and Lewis released their debut studio album, <i>The Heist</i>, on October 9, 2012, which charted at number 2 on the US <i>Billboard</i> 200. The pair won four Grammy Awards at the 2014 ceremony, including Best New Artist, Best Rap Album (<i>The Heist</i>), Best Rap Song and Best Rap Performance (""Thrift Shop"").

<p><b>Yes</b> are  an English progressive rock band formed in London in 1968 by lead singer and frontman Jon Anderson, bassist Chris Squire, guitarist Peter Banks, keyboardist Tony Kaye, and drummer Bill Bruford. The band has undergone numerous line-up changes throughout their history, during which 20 musicians have been full-time members. Since February 2023, the band has consisted of guitarist Steve Howe, keyboardist Geoff Downes, bassist Billy Sherwood, singer Jon Davison, and drummer Jay Schellen. Yes have explored several musical styles over the years and are most notably regarded as progressive rock pioneers.
</p><p>Yes began performing original songs and rearranged covers of rock, pop, blues and jazz songs, as evidenced on their self-titled first album from 1969, and its follow-up <i>Time and a Word</i> from 1970. A change of direction later in 1970 led to a series of successful progressive rock albums, with four consecutive U.S. platinum or multi-platinum sellers in <i>The Yes Album</i> (1971), <i>Fragile</i> (1971), <i>Close to the Edge</i> (1972) and the live album <i>Yessongs</i> (1973). Further albums, <i>Tales from Topographic Oceans</i> (1973), <i>Relayer</i> (1974), <i>Going for the One</i> (1977) and <i>Tormato</i> (1978), were also commercially successful. Yes toured as a major rock act that earned the band a reputation for their elaborate stage sets, light displays, and album covers designed by Roger Dean. The success of ""Roundabout"", the single from <i>Fragile</i>, cemented their popularity across the decade and beyond. Anderson and Squire remained with the group throughout the 1970s, with Banks, Kaye, and Bruford all departing across 1970–1972, and being replaced by Howe, Rick Wakeman, and Alan White, respectively. Wakeman would leave the group in 1974, but returned two years later, with Patrick Moraz taking his place in the interim. After a final album, <i>Drama</i>, and tour in 1980, both of which saw Downes and Trevor Horn replace Wakeman and Anderson, respectively, Yes disbanded in 1981.
</p><p>In 1983, Squire and White reformed Yes, with Anderson and Kaye returning, and guitarist Trevor Rabin joining. Rabin's songwriting helped move the band toward a more mainstream rock style. The result was <i>90125</i> (1983), their highest-selling album, featuring the U.S. number-one single ""Owner of a Lonely Heart"". Its follow-up, <i>Big Generator</i> (1987), was also successful. From 1991 to 1992, Yes were an eight-member formation after they merged with spinoff Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe for <i>Union</i> (1991) and its tour. From 1994 to 2004, Yes regularly released albums with varied levels of success. After a four-year hiatus, they resumed touring in 2008 and have released three new albums; their most recent is <i>The Quest</i> (2021). Throughout the long history of Yes, current and former members have often collaborated outside of the official band context; most recently, the group Yes Featuring Jon Anderson, Trevor Rabin, Rick Wakeman toured from 2016 to 2018. Among the longest serving members of the band, Squire died in 2015, and White died in 2022.
</p><p>Yes are one of the most successful, influential, and longest-lasting progressive rock bands. They have sold 13.5 million RIAA-certified albums in the U.S., as well as more than 30 million albums worldwide. In 1985, they won a Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance with ""Cinema"", and received five Grammy nominations between 1985 and 1992. They were ranked No. 94 on VH1's <i>100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock</i>. Their discography spans 22 studio albums. In April 2017, Yes were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, which chose to induct current and former members Anderson, Squire, Bruford, Kaye, Howe, Wakeman, White, and Rabin.

</p><p>Sugababes have achieved six number-one singles: ""Freak like Me"", ""Round Round"", ""Hole in the Head"", ""Push the Button"", ""Walk This Way"" and ""About You Now""; the Spice Girls are the only British girl group to have had more.

They have been a long-term fixture in the British tabloids due to their several line-up changes and alleged group infighting.

<p><b>Def Leppard</b> are an English rock band formed in 1976 in Sheffield. Since 1992, the band has consisted of Rick Savage (bass, backing vocals), Joe Elliott (lead vocals), Rick Allen (drums), Phil Collen (guitar, backing vocals), and Vivian Campbell (guitar, backing vocals). They established themselves as part of the new wave of British heavy metal movement of the early 1980s.
</p><p>The band's greatest commercial success came between the early 1980s and the early 1990s. Their first album, 1980's <i>On Through the Night</i>, reached the Top 15 in the UK but received little notice elsewhere.  Their second album, 1981's <i>High 'n' Dry</i>, was produced by Mutt Lange, who helped them begin to define their melodic hard rock style, and the album's most popular track ""Bringin' On the Heartbreak"" became one of the first rock videos played on MTV in 1982, but the album only reached the Top 30 and 40 in the UK and US. Def Leppard's next studio album, <i>Pyromania</i>, was released in January 1983, with ""Photograph"" and ""Rock of Ages"" both topping the US Rock Tracks chart and reaching the top 20 of the Hot 100. Reaching No. 2 on the US album chart, <i>Pyromania</i> was certified Diamond in the US and 7× platinum in Canada and reached the top 20 in the UK but did not sell much elsewhere.
</p><p>Def Leppard's fourth album, the more pop-oriented <i>Hysteria</i> (1987), topped the UK, US, New Zealand, Canadian, Australian and Norway charts. It also went to No. 2 in Sweden and No. 10 in Germany without any Top 50 singles in those countries. It has been certified 12× platinum for sales in the US and 13× platinum in Canada, selling over 25 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time. The album spawned six Top 20 US singles, including the US <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 No. 1 ""Love Bites"" (went Top 10 in several other countries including No. 2 in NZ), alongside ""Pour Some Sugar on Me"" (US No. 2), ""Hysteria"", ""Armageddon It"" (No. 2 in NZ), ""Animal"" (at No. 6, the biggest UK hit), and ""Rocket"" (a Top 15 hit in many countries). <i>Hysteria</i> had four Top 10 hits in New Zealand.
</p><p>Their next studio album, <i>Adrenalize</i> (their first following the death of guitarist Steve Clark), reached No. 1 on the UK, US, NZ, Canadian and Australian charts in 1992, while going Top 10 in Sweden and Germany. It contained several hits, including the US Rock Tracks chart-topper, ""Let's Get Rocked"", which became their biggest hit in several countries, including No. 2 in the UK, No. 3 in Canada and Switzerland, and the Top 20 in Sweden and Germany. The third single, ""Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad"", was a Top 15 song in the US, UK and Canada. <i>Adrenalize</i> went on to sell over eight million copies worldwide. Their 1993 album, <i>Retro Active</i>, contained the acoustic Top 5 North American hit ""Two Steps Behind"". Their greatest hits album <i>Vault</i>, released in 1995, featured the UK No. 2 hit ""When Love &amp; Hate Collide"" and reached the Top 10 in several countries, going 5× platinum in the US.  Beginning with <i>Slang</i>, Def Leppard released five albums between 1996 and 2008, with most usually reaching the Top 15 in several countries, including the UK, US and Canada.  Their self-titled album was released in 2015 and reached the Top 10 in several countries. The band's newest studio album, <i>Diamond Star Halos</i> was released in May 2022 and reached the Top 10 in the US, the UK and Australia.
</p><p>As one of the world's best-selling music artists, Def Leppard have sold more than 100 million records worldwide, and have two albums with RIAA diamond certification: <i>Pyromania</i> and <i>Hysteria</i>, making them one of only five rock bands with two original studio albums selling more than 10 million copies in the US. The band were ranked No. 31 in VH1's ""100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock"" and ranked No. 70 in ""100 Greatest Artists of All Time"".

</p>
<p><b>Ariana Grande-Butera</b> (<span></span> <i title=""English pronunciation respelling""><span>AR</span>-ee-<span>AH</span>-nə <span>GRAHN</span>-day</i>; born June 26, 1993) is an American singer, songwriter, and actress. Her four-octave vocal range has received critical acclaim, and her personal life has been the subject of widespread media attention. She has received numerous accolades throughout her career, including two Grammy Awards, one Brit Award, one Bambi Award, two <i>Billboard</i> Music Awards, three American Music Awards, nine MTV Video Music Awards, and 30 Guinness World Records. 
</p><p>Grande began her music career at age 15 in the 2008 Broadway musical <i>13</i>. She rose to fame for playing Cat Valentine in the Nickelodeon television series <i>Victorious</i> (2010–2013) and <i>Sam &amp; Cat</i> (2013–2014). Grande signed with Republic Records in 2011 after label executives viewed YouTube videos of her covering songs. Her 1950s doo-wop-influenced pop and R&amp;B debut album, <i>Yours Truly</i> (2013), topped the US <i>Billboard</i> 200, while its lead single, ""The Way"", reached the top ten of the US <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. Grande's voice and whistle register on the album drew immediate comparisons to Mariah Carey.
</p><p>She continued to explore pop and R&amp;B in her second and third studio albums, <i>My Everything</i> (2014) and <i>Dangerous Woman</i> (2016). <i>My Everything</i> experimented with EDM and achieved global success with its singles ""Problem"", ""Break Free"" and ""Bang Bang"", while <i>Dangerous Woman</i> became her first of four consecutive number-one albums in the UK. Personal struggles influenced her trap-infused fourth and fifth studio albums, <i>Sweetener</i> (2018) and <i>Thank U, Next</i> (2019), both of which were critical and commercial successes. <i>Sweetener</i> won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album, and <i>Thank U, Next</i> broke the record for the largest streaming week for a pop album and was nominated for Album of the Year. The singles ""Thank U, Next"", ""7 Rings"", and ""Break Up with Your Girlfriend, I'm Bored"" made Grande the first solo artist to hold the top three spots on the Hot 100 simultaneously and the first woman to succeed herself at the top of the UK Singles Chart. Her 2020 collaborations ""Stuck with U"" with Justin Bieber and ""Rain on Me"" with Lady Gaga helped her break the record for most number-one debuts on the Hot 100, the latter winning the Grammy Award for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance. Grande expanded on the trap genre with her sixth studio album, <i>Positions</i> (2020), which both the album and its title track debuted at number one in the UK and US. In 2021, she collaborated with The Weeknd on the remix of ""Save Your Tears"", garnering her sixth US number-one single.
</p><p>Often regarded as a pop icon and triple threat entertainer, Grande is one of the world's best-selling music artists; she has sold more than 85 to 90 million records globally and all of her studio albums have been certified platinum or higher. Among her <i>Billboard</i> chart records, she is the first artist to have five number-one debuts, the first and only solo artist to chart three number one-debuts in one calendar year, and the only artist to debut the lead singles from each of her studio albums in the top ten, and to have their first five number one singles debut at top spot. Grande is the most streamed female artist of all time, the most streamed female artist on Spotify (2010s decade) and Apple Music, the most followed female artist on Spotify, and the most subscribed female solo artist on YouTube. Nine and seven of Grande's songs and music videos reached 1 billion streams and views on Spotify and Vevo, respectively. She is the female artist with the most one billion songs on the former platform. Grande has been included on <i>Time</i><span>'</span>s annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world (2016 and 2019) and the <i>Forbes</i> Celebrity 100 (2019–2020). Grande was named Woman of the Year (2018), the greatest pop star of 2019, and the most successful female artist to debut in the 2010s by <i>Billboard</i>. Furthermore, Rolling Stone placed her in their list of 200 Greatest Singers of all time (2023). Aside from her music career, she has worked with many charitable organizations and advocates for animal rights, mental health, and gender, racial, and LGBT equality. Grande has a large following on social media; she became the most followed woman on Instagram in 2019, and has over 350 million followers as of 2023. She has also ventured into the cosmetics and fashion industries. Her fragrance line, which was released in 2015, exceeded $1 billion in sales though 2022.

</p>
<p><b>Mary Isobel Catherine Bernadette O'Brien</b>  (16 April 1939 – 2 March 1999), better known by her stage name <b>Dusty Springfield</b>, was an English singer. With her distinctive mezzo-soprano sound, she was a popular singer of blue-eyed soul, pop and dramatic ballads, with French chanson, country, and jazz also in her repertoire. During her 1960s peak, she ranked among the most successful British female performers on both sides of the Atlantic. Her image – marked by a peroxide blonde bouffant/beehive hairstyle, heavy makeup (thick black eyeliner and eye shadow) and evening gowns, as well as stylised, gestural performances – made her an icon of the Swinging Sixties.</p><p>Born in West Hampstead in London into a family that enjoyed music, Springfield learned to sing at home. In 1958, she joined her first professional group, The Lana Sisters. Two years later, with her brother Tom Springfield and Tim Feild, Springfield formed the folk-pop vocal trio The Springfields. Two of their five 1961–63 Top 40 UK hits – ""Island of Dreams"" and ""Say I Won't Be There"" – reached no. 5 in the charts, both in the spring of 1963. In 1962 they also hit big in the United States with their cover of ""Silver Threads and Golden Needles"".
</p><p>Springfield's solo career began in late 1963 with the upbeat pop record ""I Only Want to Be with You"" — a  UK no. 4 hit, and the first of her six transatlantic Top 40 hits in the 1960s, along with ""Stay Awhile"" (1964), ""All I See Is You"" (1966), ""I'll Try Anything"" (1967) and the two releases now considered her signature songs: ""You Don't Have to Say You Love Me"" (1966 UK no. 1/US no. 4) and ""Son of a Preacher Man"" (1968/69 UK no. 9/US no. 10). The latter features on the 1968 pop and soul album <i>Dusty in Memphis</i>, one of Springfield's defining works. In March 2020, the US Library of Congress added it to the National Recording Registry, which preserves audio recordings considered to be ""culturally, historically or aesthetically significant"".
</p><p>Between 1964 and 1969, Springfield hit big in her native Britain with several singles which in America either failed to chart or were not released, among them ""I Just Don't Know What to Do with Myself"" (the biggest of her many Bacharach/David covers), ""In the Middle of Nowhere"", ""Some of Your Lovin'"", ""Goin' Back"" and ""I Close My Eyes and Count to Ten"". Conversely, she charted in the US (but not in the UK) with hits including ""Wishin' and Hopin' "", ""The Look of Love"" and ""The Windmills of Your Mind"".
</p><p>From 1971 to 1986, Springfield failed to register a hit from five album releases (aside from a minor 1979 UK chart appearance), but her 1987 collaboration with UK synthpop duo Pet Shop Boys, ""What Have I Done to Deserve This?"", took her back to the top of the charts, reaching no. 2 on both the UK singles chart and <i>Billboard</i>'s Hot 100. The collaboration also yielded two 1989 UK Top 20 hits: ""Nothing Has Been Proved"" and ""In Private"". In 1990, Springfield charted with ""Reputation"" – the last of 25 Top 40 UK hits in which she features.
</p><p>A fixture on British television, Springfield presented many episodes of the hip 1963–66 British TV music series <i>Ready Steady Go!</i> and, between 1966 and 69, hosted her own series on the BBC and ITV. In 1966, Springfield topped the popularity polls, including <i>Melody Maker</i><span>'</span>s Best International Vocalist, and was the first UK singer to top the <i>New Musical Express</i> readers' poll for Female Singer. She is a member of both the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame and the UK Music Hall of Fame. International polls have lauded Springfield as one of the finest female popular singers of all time.

<p><b>Aaliyah Dana Haughton</b> (<span></span> <i title=""English pronunciation respelling"">ah-<span>LEE</span>-ə</i>; January 16, 1979 – August 25, 2001) was an American singer and actress. She has been credited for helping to redefine contemporary R&amp;B, pop and hip hop, earning her the nicknames the ""Princess of R&amp;B"" and ""Queen of Urban Pop"".
</p><p>Born in Brooklyn but raised in Detroit, she first gained recognition at the age of 10, when she appeared on the television show <i>Star Search</i> and performed in concert alongside Gladys Knight. At the age of 12, Aaliyah signed with Jive Records and her uncle Barry Hankerson's Blackground Records. Hankerson introduced her to R. Kelly, who became her mentor, as well as lead songwriter and producer of her debut album, <i>Age Ain't Nothing but a Number</i>. The album sold three million copies in the United States and was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). After allegations of an illegal marriage with Kelly, Aaliyah ended her contract with Jive and signed with Atlantic Records.
</p><p>Aaliyah worked with record producers Timbaland and Missy Elliott for her second album, <i>One in a Million</i>, which sold three million copies in the United States and more than eight million copies worldwide. In 2000, Aaliyah appeared in her first film, <i>Romeo Must Die</i>. She contributed to the film's soundtrack, which spawned the single ""Try Again"". The song topped the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 solely on airplay, making Aaliyah the first artist in <i>Billboard</i> history to achieve this goal. After completing <i>Romeo Must Die</i>, Aaliyah filmed her role in <i>Queen of the Damned</i>, and released, in 2001, her third and final album <i>Aaliyah</i>, which topped the <i>Billboard</i> 200.
</p><p>On August 25, 2001, Aaliyah died at the age of 22 in an airplane accident in the Bahamas, when the overloaded aircraft she was traveling in crashed shortly after takeoff, killing all nine on board. The pilot was later found to have traces of cocaine and alcohol in his body and was not qualified to fly the aircraft designated for the flight. Aaliyah's family later filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the aircraft's operator, Blackhawk International Airways, which was settled out of court. In the decades since her death, Aaliyah's music has continued to achieve commercial success, aided by several posthumous releases. She has sold 8.1 million albums in the US and an estimated 24 to 32 million albums worldwide. <i>Billboard</i> lists her as the tenth most successful female R&amp;B artist of the past 25 years, and the 27th most successful in history. Her accolades include three American Music Awards and two MTV VMAs, along with five Grammy Award nominations.

The group currently consists of lead vocalist Oliver Sykes, guitarist Lee Malia, bassist Matt Kean, drummer Matt Nicholls and keyboardist Jordan Fish. They are signed to RCA Records globally and Columbia Records exclusively in the United States.
</p><p>The band released their debut album <i>Count Your Blessings</i> in 2006. Upon release, the album's deathcore sound polarised listeners, and was largely met with critical disdain. The band began to break away from this sound with their second album <i>Suicide Season</i> (2008), which was considered a creative, critical and commercial turning point for the band. Bring Me the Horizon released their third album, <i>There Is a Hell Believe Me I've Seen It. There Is a Heaven Let's Keep It a Secret.</i>, in 2010, propelling them to greater international fame, whilst incorporating influences from classical music, electronica and pop. Their major label debut, <i>Sempiternal</i>, (2013) achieved Gold certification in Australia (35,000) and Silver in the United Kingdom (60,000). <i>That's the Spirit</i> (2015) debuted at number two in the UK Albums Chart and the US <i>Billboard</i> 200. Their sixth studio album <i>Amo</i> (2019) became their first UK chart-topper. The same year, the band also put out the commercial release, <i>Music to Listen To...</i> (2019). The following year, the band released <i>Post Human: Survival Horror</i> (2020), the first in a planned series of four projects under the <i>Post Human</i> name. The band have also released two extended plays and two live albums. They have received four <i>Kerrang!</i> Awards, including two for Best British Band and one for Best Live Band, and have been nominated for two Grammy Awards. The band has sold over 4 million records worldwide, and have topped the UK Rock &amp; Metal Singles Chart with songs such as ""Throne"", ""Drown, ""Mantra"" and ""Parasite Eve"".</p><p>The style of their early work, including their debut album <i>Count Your Blessings</i>, has been described primarily as deathcore, but over the course of several albums, the band has shifted its style and moved in a more melodically-oriented direction by combining their approach to metalcore with elements of electronica, pop and hip hop.</p>

</p>
<p><b>Jethro Tull</b> are  a British rock band formed in Luton, England, in 1967. Initially playing blues rock and jazz fusion, the band soon incorporated elements of English folk, hard rock, and classical music, forging a signature progressive rock sound. The group’s bandleader, founder, primary composer, and only constant member is Ian Anderson, a multi-instrumentalist who mainly plays flute and acoustic guitar, and is also the lead vocalist. The group has featured a succession of musicians throughout the decades, including significant contributors such as electric guitarist Martin Barre (the longest serving member besides Anderson), keyboardists John Evan, Dee Palmer, Peter-John Vettese, and Andrew Giddings, drummers Clive Bunker, Barrie ""Barriemore"" Barlow, and Doane Perry, and bassists Glenn Cornick, Jeffrey Hammond, John Glascock, Dave Pegg, and Jonathan Noyce.
</p><p>The band achieved moderate recognition in the London club scene and released their debut album, <i>This Was</i>, in 1968. After a lineup change which saw original guitarist Mick Abrahams replaced by Martin Barre, the band released their folk-tinged second album <i>Stand Up</i> in 1969. <i>Stand Up</i> saw the band achieve their first commercial success, reaching No. 1 in the UK, which was followed by regular tours of the UK and the US. The musical style shifted in the direction of progressive rock with the albums <i>Aqualung</i> (1971), <i>Thick as a Brick</i> (1972), and <i>A Passion Play</i> (1973), and shifted again to contemporary folk rock with <i>Songs from the Wood</i> (1977), <i>Heavy Horses</i> (1978), and <i>Stormwatch</i> (1979). In the early 1980s, the band underwent a major lineup change and shifted towards electronic rock, with the albums <i>A</i> (1980), <i>The Broadsword and the Beast</i> (1982), and <i>Under Wraps</i> (1984). The band won their sole Grammy Award for the 1987 album <i>Crest of a Knave</i>, which saw them returning to a hard rock style. Jethro Tull have sold an estimated 60 million albums worldwide, with 11 gold and five platinum albums. They have been described by <i>Rolling Stone</i> as ""one of the most commercially successful and eccentric progressive rock bands.""</p><p>The last works as a group to contain new material prior to their hiatus were <i>J-Tull Dot Com</i> (1999) and a Christmas album in 2003, though the band continued to tour until 2011. Both Anderson and Barre have continued to record and tour as solo artists. Anderson said in 2014 that Jethro Tull ""came more or less to an end."" The current group—now billed as ""Ian Anderson and the Jethro Tull band""—includes musicians who were part of Jethro Tull during the last years of its initial run as well as newer musicians associated with Anderson's solo band, without Barre's involvement. Jethro Tull released <i>The Zealot Gene</i> in 2022 following a gap of 19 years, and are currently working on a 23rd album, titled <i>RökFlöte</i>.</p>",Luton

</p>
<p><b>The Mars Volta</b> is an American progressive rock band from El Paso, Texas, formed in 2001. The band's only constant members are Omar Rodríguez-López (guitar, producer, direction) and Cedric Bixler-Zavala (vocals, lyrics), whose partnership forms the core of the band. The band's current line-up also includes founding member Eva Gardner (bass), Omar's brother Marcel Rodríguez-López (keyboards, synths, percussion), Linda-Philomène Tsoungui (drums) and Leo Genovese (keyboards, saxophone).
</p><p>Known for their energetic live shows and concept albums, The Mars Volta formed following the break-up of Rodríguez-López and Bixler-Zavala's previous band, At the Drive-In. Seeking to experiment and expand their sound, Rodríguez-López and Bixler-Zavala recruited Gardner, Isaiah ""Ikey"" Owens (keyboards), Jon Theodore (drums) and Jeremy Ward (sound manipulation) to form The Mars Volta. The band released their debut EP, <i>Tremulant</i>, in 2002, with Gardner leaving the band prior to recording their debut album, <i>De-Loused in the Comatorium</i>. She was replaced by Red Hot Chili Peppers bass guitarist Flea for the sessions. The Rick Rubin-produced album received widespread critical acclaim upon its release in 2003.
</p><p>The band's second studio album, <i>Frances the Mute</i> (2005), was self-produced by Rodríguez-López and was the first to feature longterm members Juan Alderete (bass) and Marcel Rodríguez-López. The album debuted at #4 on the US <i>Billboard</i> 200 and became the band's biggest commercial success, selling over 500,000 copies in the US and achieving Gold certification from the RIAA. The band's third studio album, <i>Amputechture</i>, was released in 2006 and was the last album to feature Theodore. In 2008, the band released <i>The Bedlam in Goliath</i>, a concept album inspired by the band's turbulent experiences with a ouija-type talking board. The album's first single, ""Wax Simulacra"" was awarded a Grammy Award in 2009 for Best Hard Rock Performance. The band released its fifth album, <i>Octahedron</i>, in June 2009. 
</p><p>Following the release of their sixth album, <i>Noctourniquet</i> (2012), and a run of reunion shows with At the Drive-In, The Mars Volta entered a hiatus in September 2012. Rodríguez-López subsequently formed a new project, Bosnian Rainbows, and the band formally broke up after disagreements between Rodríguez-López and Bixler-Zavala. The duo repaired their friendship and reunited in 2014 for a new project, Antemasque, and further At the Drive-In tours and recording sessions.
</p><p>Reuniting in secret in 2019, Rodríguez-López and Bixler-Zavala recorded a new studio album, <i>The Mars Volta</i>, with Gardner, Marcel Rodríguez-López and drummer Willy Rodriguez Quiñones. The band announced their reunion – after ten years of public inactivity – with an art installation called L'ytome Hodorxí Telesterion, in June 2022. For the band's live return, jazz pianist Leo Genovese and drummer Linda-Philomène Tsoungui were added to the line-up.

<p><b>Roy Kelton Orbison</b> (April 23, 1936 – December 6, 1988) was an American singer-songwriter and musician. Orbison's career spanned over four decades, he is noted for his impassioned singing style, complex song structures, and dark, emotional ballads. His music was described by critics as operatic, earning him the honorific nicknames ""The Caruso of Rock"" and ""The Big O."" Many of Orbison's songs conveyed vulnerability at a time when most male rock-and-roll performers projected machismo. He performed while standing motionless and wearing black clothes to match his dyed black hair and dark sunglasses.
</p><p>Born in Texas, Orbison began singing in a rockabilly and country-and-western band as a teenager. He was signed by Sam Phillips of Sun Records in 1956, but enjoyed his greatest success with Monument Records. From 1960 to 1966, 22 of Orbison's singles reached the US <i>Billboard</i> Top 40. He wrote or co-wrote almost all of his own Top 10 hits, including ""Only the Lonely"" (1960), ""Running Scared"" (1961), ""Crying"" (1961), ""In Dreams"" (1963), and ""Oh, Pretty Woman"" (1964).
</p><p>After the mid-1960s, Orbison suffered a number of personal tragedies and his career faltered. He experienced a resurgence in popularity in the 1980s following the success of several cover versions of his songs. In 1988, he co-founded the Traveling Wilburys (a rock  supergroup) with George Harrison, Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, and Jeff Lynne. Orbison died of a heart attack in December 1988 at age 52. One month later, his song ""You Got It"" (1989) was released as a solo single, becoming his first hit to reach the US and UK Top 10 in nearly 25 years.
</p><p>Orbison's honors include inductions into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1987, the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1989, and the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in 2014. He received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and five other Grammy Awards. <i>Rolling Stone</i> placed him at number 37 on its list of the ""Greatest Artists of All Time"" and number 13 on its list of the ""100 Greatest Singers of All Time"". In 2002, <i>Billboard</i> magazine listed him at number 74 on its list of the Top 600 recording artists.

</p><p>Badu's career began after she opened a show for D'Angelo in 1994 in Fort Worth, leading to record label executive Kedar Massenburg signing her to Kedar Entertainment. Her first album, <i>Baduizm</i>, was released in February 1997. It spawned four singles: ""On &amp; On"", ""Appletree"", ""Next Lifetime"" and ""Otherside of the Game"".

It contained the album's lead single ""Window Seat"", which led to controversy.
</p><p>Badu's voice has been compared to jazz singer Billie Holiday. Early in her career, Badu was recognizable for her eccentric style, which often included wearing very large and colorful headwraps. She was a core member of the Soulquarians.

</p>
<p><b>Mötley Crüe</b> is an American heavy metal band formed in Hollywood, California  in 1981. The group was founded by bassist Nikki Sixx, drummer Tommy Lee, lead guitarist Mick Mars and lead singer Vince Neil. Mötley Crüe has sold over 100 million albums worldwide. They have also achieved seven platinum or multi-platinum certifications, nine Top 10 albums on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 chart (including 1989's <i>Dr. Feelgood</i>, which is Mötley Crüe's only album to reach number one), twenty-two Top 40 mainstream rock hits, and six Top 20 pop singles. The band experienced several short-term lineup changes in the 1990s and 2000s; these included the introduction of vocalist John Corabi (who was Neil's replacement from 1992 to 1996) and drummers Randy Castillo and Samantha Maloney, both of whom filled in for Lee following his departure from Mötley Crüe in 1999; he returned to the band in 2004. More recently in 2022 guitarist Mick Mars announced his retirement from touring with the band, with former Marilyn Manson and Rob Zombie guitarist John 5 taking his place on live duties.
</p><p>The members of Mötley Crüe have often been noted for their hedonistic lifestyles and the androgynous personae they maintained. Following the hard rock and heavy metal origins on the band's first two albums, <i>Too Fast for Love</i> (1981) and <i>Shout at the Devil</i> (1983), the release of its third album <i>Theatre of Pain</i> (1985) saw Mötley Crüe joining the first wave of glam metal. The band has also been known for their elaborate live performances, which feature flame thrower guitars, roller coaster drum kits, and heavy use of pyrotechnics (fireworks) (including lighting Sixx on fire). Mötley Crüe's last studio album, <i>Saints of Los Angeles</i>, was released on June 24, 2008. What was planned to be the band's final show took place on New Year's Eve, December 31, 2015. The concert was filmed for a theatrical and Blu-ray release in 2016.</p><p>After two-and-a-half years of inactivity, Neil announced in September 2018 that Mötley Crüe had reunited and was working on new material. On March 22, 2019, the band released four new songs on the soundtrack for its Netflix biopic <i>The Dirt</i>, based on the band's <i>New York Times</i> best-selling autobiography of the same name. The soundtrack went to number one on the iTunes All Genres Album Chart, number 3 on the <i>Billboard</i> Top Album and Digital Album sales charts, number 10 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200, and Top 10 worldwide. The autobiography returned to <i>New York Times</i> Best Seller list at number 6 on Nonfiction Print and number 8 on Nonfiction Combined Print &amp; E-Book. Mötley Crüe embarked on its first major tour in seven years in the summer and fall of 2022, co-headlining a North American tour with Def Leppard.</p>",Hollywood

</p>
<p><b>Within Temptation</b> is a Dutch symphonic metal band founded in April 1996 by vocalist Sharon den Adel and guitarist Robert Westerholt. They have been classified by critics as gothic metal and symphonic metal, although each album contains other influences outside these genres. Their most prominent and well-known sound is described as symphonic metal, although their earlier material, such as debut album <i>Enter</i>, was mostly gothic metal, with <i>Enter</i> also having a hint of doom metal. In an interview, den Adel said they fell into a symphonic rock genre with various influences. In another interview, den Adel stated that ""We consider ourselves more an atmospheric melodic symphonic metal/rock band... In my opinion, we are not a gothic band but we have gothic elements"".</p><p>After the release of their debut album <i>Enter</i> in 1997, the band became prominent in the Dutch underground scene. It was not until 2001 that they became known to the general public, with the single ""Ice Queen"" from their second album <i>Mother Earth</i>, which reached No. 2 on the Dutch charts. This was followed by the band winning the Conamus Exportprijs, a Dutch music award, four years in a row, and a fifth in 2016. Their next albums <i>The Silent Force</i> (2004) and <i>The Heart of Everything</i> (2007) debuted at No. 1 on the Dutch charts and expanded their international recognition. In 2008, they released <i>Black Symphony</i>, a live album recorded with the Metropole Orchestra. This was followed in 2009 by <i>An Acoustic Night at the Theatre</i>, another live album, this time with acoustic renditions of the songs.
</p><p>The band's fifth studio album, <i>The Unforgiving</i>, was released in March 2011 and was one part of a transmedia effort, alongside both a comic book series and a series of short films that together encompass a story. The album saw the band increasingly venturing on new musical territories outside symphonic metal. Their sixth studio album, <i>Hydra</i>, was released in early 2014 in Japan, Europe, and the United States. The album advanced the band's exploration of new musical genres and features guest appearances from various artists: Finnish singer Tarja Turunen, who appears in the lead single ""Paradise (What About Us?)""; Howard Jones, former vocalist of American metalcore band Killswitch Engage; Dave Pirner, lead vocalist of American alternative rock band Soul Asylum; and American rapper Xzibit. The band had extensive airplay on BBC Radio 2 in the United Kingdom with one of the songs from the album, ""Whole World Is Watching"" featuring Pirner.
</p><p>Their latest studio album, <i>Resist</i>, was released in February 2019 and incorporates influences from other musical styles such as industrial and EDM. By 2016, the band had already sold more than 3.5 million albums worldwide.</p>

</p>
<p><b>N.W.A</b> (an abbreviation for <b>Niggaz Wit Attitudes</b>) was an American hip hop group whose members were among the earliest and most significant popularizers and controversial figures of the gangsta rap subgenre, and the group is widely considered one of the greatest and most influential groups in the history of hip hop music.</p><p>Active from 1987 to 1991, the rap group endured controversy owing to its music's explicit lyrics, which many viewed as being misogynistic, as well as to its glorification of drugs and crime. The group was subsequently banned from many mainstream American radio stations. In spite of this, the group has sold over 10 million units in the United States alone. Drawing on its members' own experiences of racism and excessive policing, the group made inherently political music. The group's members were known for their deep hatred of the police system, which has sparked much controversy over the years.
</p><p>The original lineup, formed in early 1987, consisted of Arabian Prince, Dr. Dre, Eazy-E, and Ice Cube, with DJ Yella and MC Ren joining later that year. They released their first compilation album as a group in 1987 called <i>N.W.A. and the Posse</i>, which peaked at No. 39 on <i>Billboard</i> magazine's Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. Arabian Prince left shortly after the release of N.W.A's debut studio album, <i>Straight Outta Compton</i>, in 1988, with Ice Cube following suit in December 1989. Eazy-E, Ice Cube, MC Ren and Dr. Dre later became platinum-selling solo artists in their own right in the 1990s. The group's debut album marked the beginning of the new gangsta rap era as the production and social commentary in their lyrics were revolutionary within the genre. N.W.A's second studio album, <i>Niggaz4Life</i>, was the first hardcore rap album to reach number one on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 sales charts.</p><p><i>Rolling Stone</i> ranked N.W.A at number 83 on its list of the ""100 Greatest Artists of All Time"". In 2016, the group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, following three previous nominations.

<p><b>John William Coltrane</b> (September 23, 1926 – July 17, 1967) was an American jazz saxophonist, bandleader and composer. He is among the most influential and acclaimed figures in the history of jazz and 20th-century music.
</p><p>Born and raised in North Carolina, Coltrane moved to Philadelphia after graduating high school, where he studied music. Working in the bebop and hard bop idioms early in his career, Coltrane helped pioneer the use of modes and was one of the players at the forefront of free jazz. He led at least fifty recording sessions and appeared on many albums by other musicians, including trumpeter Miles Davis and pianist Thelonious Monk. Over the course of his career, Coltrane's music took on an increasingly spiritual dimension, as exemplified on his most acclaimed album <i>A Love Supreme</i> (1965) and others. Decades after his death, Coltrane remains influential, and he has received numerous posthumous awards, including a special Pulitzer Prize, and was canonized by the African Orthodox Church.</p><p>His second wife was pianist and harpist Alice Coltrane.  The couple had three children: John Jr. (1964–1982), a bassist; Ravi (born 1965), a saxophonist; and Oran (born 1967), a saxophonist, guitarist, drummer and singer.</p>",

<p><b>Pavement</b> is an American indie rock band that formed in Stockton, California, in 1989. For most of their career, the group consisted of Stephen Malkmus (vocals and guitar), Scott Kannberg (guitar and vocals), Mark Ibold (bass), Steve West (drums) and Bob Nastanovich (percussion and vocals). Initially conceived as a recording project, the band at first avoided press or live performances, while attracting considerable underground attention with their early releases. Gradually evolving into a more polished band, Pavement recorded five full-length albums and ten EPs over the course of their decade-long career, though they disbanded with some acrimony in 1999 as the members moved on to other projects. In 2010, they undertook a well-received reunion tour, with another international tour currently ongoing in 2022 and 2023.</p><p>Though only briefly attracting mainstream attention with the single ""Cut Your Hair"" in 1994, Pavement was a successful indie rock band. Rather than signing with a major label as many of their 1980s forebears had done, they remained signed to independent labels throughout their career, including Flying Nun and Matador. They have often been described as one of the most influential bands to emerge from the American underground in the '90s. Some prominent music critics, such as Robert Christgau and Stephen Thomas Erlewine, called them the best band of the 1990s. They have achieved a cult following.</p>

</p>
<p><i><b>Glee</b></i> (stylized as <i><b>glee</b></i>) is  an American musical comedy-drama television series that aired on Fox network in the United States from May 19, 2009, to March 20, 2015. It centers on the New Directions, a glee club at the fictional William McKinley High School which competes as a show choir while its disparate members deal with social issues, especially regarding sexuality, race, family, teen relationships and teamwork.
</p><p>The initial twelve-member cast included Matthew Morrison as club director and Spanish teacher Will Schuester, Jane Lynch as scheming cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester, Jayma Mays as the OCD guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury, Jessalyn Gilsig as Will's wife Terri, and the eight original club members, including Dianna Agron as Quinn Fabray, a popular cheerleader whose biggest struggle is her teenage pregnancy; Chris Colfer as Kurt Hummel, a gay boy who feels conflicted by his sexuality and is bullied at school; Kevin McHale as Artie Abrams, who lives with a physical disability; Lea Michele as Rachel Berry, driven by her dreams of becoming a Broadway theatre star and the glee club's most obvious star singer; Cory Monteith as Finn Hudson, the school's star quarterback who sometimes appears not to be very smart; Amber Riley as Mercedes Jones, an African American girl who endeavors to be recognized for her talents and dreams of being a vocal diva; Mark Salling as Noah Puckerman, a teenage delinquent in need of direction; and Jenna Ushkowitz as Tina Cohen-Chang, a shy girl of Korean descent who longs to be popular and sometimes experiences racism. The main cast was altered throughout the series, including the addition of Naya Rivera as Santana Lopez, an unapologetically Latina cheerleader experiencing deep conflict over her sexuality, Harry Shum Jr. as Mike Chang, a dancer with Chinese roots whose parents do not support his dreams, and Heather Morris as Brittany Pierce, a ditzy cheerleader who is secretly a math prodigy and comes to realize she is bisexual.
</p><p>The series was created by Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk, and Ian Brennan, the latter of whom first conceived of <i>Glee</i> as a film. The three wrote all of the show's episodes for the first two seasons, and Murphy and Falchuk initially served as the show's main directors. The pilot episode was broadcast on May 19, 2009, and the first season aired from September 9, 2009, to June 8, 2010. Subsequent seasons aired from September through May. The sixth and final season aired from January to March 2015. <i>Glee</i> features on-screen performance-based musical numbers that were selected by Murphy, who aimed to maintain a balance between show tunes and chart hits, and produced by Adam Anders and Peer Åström. Songs covered in the show were released through the iTunes Store during the week of broadcast, and a series of <i>Glee</i> albums have been released by Columbia Records. The music of <i>Glee</i> has been a commercial success, with over 36 million digital single sales and eleven million album sales worldwide through October 2011. The series' merchandise also includes DVD and Blu-ray releases, an iPad application, and karaoke games for the Wii home videogame console. There were live concert tours by the show's cast after the first and second seasons completed shooting; a concert film based on the 2011 tour, <i>Glee: The 3D Concert Movie</i>, was produced by Murphy and Fox and directed by Kevin Tancharoen.
</p><p>During its first season, <i>Glee</i> received generally favorable reviews from critics, with Metacritic's weighted average of 77 out of 100 based on 18 critical reviews. <i>Glee</i> has won many accolades. The season was nominated for 19 Emmy Awards, four Golden Globe Awards, six Satellite Awards and 57 other awards, with wins including the 2010 Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy, and Emmy awards for Jane Lynch, guest-star Neil Patrick Harris and Murphy's direction of the pilot episode. In 2011, the show once again won the Golden Globe for Best Television Series, and Jane Lynch and Chris Colfer won Golden Globes for Best Supporting Actress and Best Supporting Actor respectively, and Gwyneth Paltrow won the Emmy for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series. The show was also chosen by Fox to fill the coveted time slot that followed the network's coverage of Super Bowl XLV in 2011.
</p><p>In 2013, in the wake of the death of Cory Monteith, and after his tribute episode ""The Quarterback"" aired, Murphy announced that the sixth season would be the series' last. After 121 episodes and over 729 music performances, the series concluded on March 20, 2015.</p>",HDTV

</p>
<p><b>Harry Lillis</b> ""<b>Bing</b>"" <b>Crosby Jr.</b> (May 3, 1903 – October 14, 1977) was an American singer and actor. The first multimedia star, he was one of the most popular and influential musical artists of the 20th century worldwide. He was a leader in record sales, radio ratings, and motion picture grosses from 1926 to 1977. He was one of the first global cultural icons. He made over 70 feature films and recorded more than 1,600 songs.</p><p>His early career coincided with recording innovations that allowed him to develop an intimate singing style that influenced many male singers who followed, such as Frank Sinatra, Perry Como, Dean Martin, Dick Haymes, Elvis Presley, and John Lennon. <i>Yank</i> magazine said that he was ""the person who had done the most for the morale of overseas servicemen"" during World War II. In 1948, American polls declared him the ""most admired man alive"", ahead of Jackie Robinson and Pope Pius XII.<sup class=""reference nowrap""><span title=""Page / location: 6"">: 6 </span></sup> In 1948, <i>Music Digest</i> estimated that his recordings filled more than half of the 80,000 weekly hours allocated to recorded radio music in America.</p><p>Crosby won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance in <i>Going My Way</i> (1944) and was nominated for its sequel, <i>The Bells of St. Mary's</i> (1945), opposite Ingrid Bergman, becoming the first of six actors to be nominated twice for playing the same character. He was the number one box office attraction for five consecutive years, 1944 to 1948. At his screen apex in 1946, Crosby starred in three of the year's five highest-grossing films: <i>The Bells of St. Mary's</i>, <i>Blue Skies</i> and <i>Road to Utopia</i>. In 1963, Crosby received the first Grammy Global Achievement Award. He is one of 33 people to have three stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, in the categories of motion pictures, radio, and audio recording. He was also known for his collaborations with his friend Bob Hope, starring in the <i>Road to...</i> films from 1940 to 1962.
</p><p>Crosby influenced the development of the post World War II recording industry. After seeing a demonstration of a German broadcast quality reel-to-reel tape recorder brought to the United States by John T. Mullin, he invested $50,000 in the California electronics company Ampex to build copies. He then persuaded ABC to allow him to tape his shows. He became the first performer to prerecord his radio shows and master his commercial recordings onto magnetic tape. Crosby has been associated with the Christmas season since Irving Berlin's musical film <i>Holiday Inn</i>, in which he starred and sang songs such as ""White Christmas"" and ""Happy Holiday"". Through audio recordings, he produced his radio programs with the same directorial tools and craftsmanship (editing, retaking, rehearsal, time shifting) used in motion picture production, a practice that became the industry standard. In addition to his work with early audio tape recording, he helped finance the development of videotape, bought television stations, bred racehorses, and co-owned the Pittsburgh Pirates baseball team, during which time the team won two World Series (1960 and 1971).

</p>
<p><b>The Yardbirds</b> are an English rock band, formed in London in 1963. The band's core lineup featured vocalist and harmonica player Keith Relf, drummer Jim McCarty, rhythm guitarist and later bassist Chris Dreja, and bassist/producer Paul Samwell-Smith. The band started the careers of three of rock's most famous guitarists: Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page, all of whom ranked in the top five of <i>Rolling Stone</i> magazine's list of 100 greatest guitarists. The band had a string of hits throughout the mid-1960s, including ""For Your Love"", ""Heart Full of Soul"", ""Shapes of Things"", and ""Over Under Sideways Down"".
</p><p>Originally a blues-based band noted for their signature ""rave-up"" instrumental breaks, the Yardbirds broadened their range into pop, pioneering psychedelic rock and early hard rock; and contributed to many electric guitar innovations of the mid-1960s. Some rock critics and historians also cite their influence on the later punk rock, progressive rock, and heavy metal trends. Following the band's split in 1968, Relf and McCarty formed Renaissance and guitarist Jimmy Page formed Led Zeppelin – the latter of which was initially intended as a direct successor to the Yardbirds. The Yardbirds re-formed in the 1990s, featuring McCarty and Dreja as the only original members. Dreja left the band in 2012, leaving McCarty as the sole original member of the band in the present lineup.
</p><p>The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992. They were included at number 89 in <i>Rolling Stone</i><span>'s</span> list of the ""100 Greatest Artists of All Time"" and ranked number 37 on VH1's <i>100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock</i>.</p>",London

<p><b>Dream Theater</b> is an American progressive metal band formed in 1985 under the name <b>Majesty</b> by John Petrucci, John Myung and Mike Portnoy while they attended Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts. They subsequently dropped out of their studies to concentrate further on the band that would eventually become Dream Theater. Their current lineup consists of Petrucci, Myung, vocalist James LaBrie, keyboardist Jordan Rudess and drummer Mike Mangini.
</p><p>Over the course of various lineup changes, Petrucci and Myung have been the only two constant members, and Portnoy remained with the band until 2010, when he left to pursue other musical endeavors and he has since been replaced by Mangini. After a brief stint with Chris Collins, followed by Charlie Dominici (who was dismissed from Dream Theater not long after the release of their first album), LaBrie was hired as the band's singer in 1991. Dream Theater's first keyboardist, Kevin Moore, left the band after three albums and was replaced by Derek Sherinian in 1995 after a period of touring. After just one album with Sherinian, they replaced him with current keyboardist Jordan Rudess in 1999.
</p><p>To date, Dream Theater has released fifteen studio albums. The band's highest-selling release is their second album <i>Images and Words</i> (1992), which reached No. 61 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 chart. Both the albums <i>Awake</i> (1994) and <i>Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence</i> (2002) also entered the charts at No. 32 and No. 46, respectively, and received critical acclaim. Their fifth album, <i>Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory</i> (1999), was ranked number 95 on the October 2006 issue of <i>Guitar World</i> magazine's list of the greatest 100 guitar albums of all time. It was also ranked as the 15th Greatest Concept Album in March 2003 by <i>Classic Rock Magazine</i>.</p><p>As of 2018, Dream Theater has sold over 12 million records worldwide and has received three Grammy Award nominations (including one win in 2022). Along with Queensrÿche and Fates Warning, the band has been referred to as one of the ""big three"" of the progressive metal genre, responsible for its development and popularization.</p>",Boston

<p><b>Roberta Joan</b> ""<b>Joni</b>"" <b>Mitchell</b>  (née <b>Anderson</b>; born November 7, 1943) is a Canadian-American musician, producer, and painter. Among the most influential singer-songwriters to emerge from the 1960s folk music circuit, Mitchell became known for her starkly personal lyrics and unconventional compositions, which grew to incorporate pop and jazz influences. She has received many accolades, including ten Grammy Awards and induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997. <i>Rolling Stone</i> called her ""one of the greatest songwriters ever"", and AllMusic has stated, ""When the dust settles, Joni Mitchell may stand as the most important and influential female recording artist of the late 20th century"".</p><p>Mitchell began singing in small nightclubs in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, and throughout western Canada, before moving on to the nightclubs of Toronto, Ontario. She moved to the United States and began touring in 1965. Some of her original songs (""Urge for Going"", ""Chelsea Morning"", ""Both Sides, Now"", ""The Circle Game"") were recorded by other folk singers, allowing her to sign with Reprise Records and record her debut album, <i>Song to a Seagull</i>, in 1968. Settling in Southern California, Mitchell helped define an era and a generation with popular songs like ""Big Yellow Taxi"" and ""Woodstock"". Her 1971 album <i>Blue</i> is often cited as one of the best albums of all time; it was rated the 30th best album ever made in <i>Rolling Stone</i><span>'</span>s 2003 list of the ""500 Greatest Albums of All Time"", rising to number 3 in the 2020 edition. In 2000, <i>The New York Times</i> chose <i>Blue</i> as one of the 25 albums that represented ""turning points and pinnacles in 20th-century popular music"". NPR ranked <i>Blue</i> number 1 on a 2017 list of Greatest Albums Made By Women.</p><p>Mitchell switched labels and began exploring more jazz-influenced ideas, by way of lush pop textures, on 1974's <i>Court and Spark</i>, which featured the radio hits ""Help Me"" and ""Free Man in Paris"" and became her best-selling album. Mitchell's vocal range began to shift from mezzo-soprano to more of a wide-ranging contralto around 1975. Her distinctive piano and open-tuned guitar compositions also grew more harmonically and rhythmically complex as she melded jazz with rock and roll, R&amp;B, classical music and non-Western beats. In the late 1970s, she began working with noted jazz musicians including Jaco Pastorius, Tom Scott, Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, and Pat Metheny as well as Charles Mingus, who asked her to collaborate on his final recordings. She later turned to pop and electronic music and engaged in political protest. She was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 44th Annual Grammy Awards in 2002.</p><p>Mitchell produced or co-produced most of her albums and designed most of her own album covers, describing herself as a ""painter derailed by circumstance"". A critic of the music industry, she quit touring and released her 17th and last album of original songs in 2007.  She would give occasional interviews and make appearances to speak on various causes over the next two decades, though the rupture of a brain aneurysm in 2015 led to a long period of recovery and therapy.  A series of retrospective compilations were released over the time period, culminating in the Joni Mitchell Archives, a project to publish much of Joni's unreleased material from her long career.  She returned to public appearances in 2021, accepting several awards in person, including a Kennedy Center Honor in 2021.  She performed live for the first time in 9 years, with an unannounced appearance at the June 2022 Newport Folk Festival, and is scheduled to perform a headline show on June 10, 2023.

</p>
<p><b>Nancy Sandra Sinatra</b> (born June 8, 1940) is an American  singer and actress. She is the elder daughter of Frank Sinatra and Nancy Sinatra (<span title=""Name at birth"">née </span> Barbato), and is best known for her 1966 signature hit ""These Boots Are Made for Walkin'<span>""</span>.
</p><p>Nancy Sinatra began her career as a singer and actress in November 1957 with an appearance on her father's ABC-TV variety series, but initially achieved success only in Europe and Japan. In early 1966 she had a transatlantic number-one hit with ""These Boots Are Made for Walkin<span>'</span>"". A TV promo clip from the era features Sinatra in high boots, accompanied by colorfully dressed go-go dancers, in what is now considered an iconic Swinging Sixties look. The song was written by Lee Hazlewood, who wrote and produced most of her hits and sang with her on several duets. As with all of Sinatra's 1960s hits, ""Boots"" featured Billy Strange as arranger and conductor.
</p><p>Between early 1966 and early 1968, Sinatra charted on <i>Billboard'</i>s Hot 100 with 14 titles, ten of which reached the Top 40. In addition to ""These Boots Are Made for Walkin<span>'</span>"", defining recordings during this period include ""Sugar Town"", ""Love Eyes"", the transatlantic 1967 number one ""Somethin' Stupid"" (a duet with her father), two versions of the title song from the James Bond film <i>You Only Live Twice</i> (1967), several collaborations with Lee Hazlewood – including ""Summer Wine"", ""Jackson"", ""Lady Bird"" and ""Some Velvet Morning"" – and a non-single 1966 cover of the Cher hit ""Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)"", which features in the opening credits of Quentin Tarantino's 2003 film <i>Kill Bill Volume 1</i>. In 1971 Sinatra and Hazlewood achieved their first collaborative success in the UK singles chart with the no. 2 hit ""Did You Ever?"", and the 2005 UK no. 3 hit by Audio Bullys, ""Shot You Down"", sampled Sinatra's version of ""Bang Bang"".
</p><p>Between 1964 and 1968 Sinatra appeared in several feature films, co-starring with Peter Fonda in Roger Corman's biker-gang movie <i>The Wild Angels</i> (1966) and alongside Elvis Presley in the musical drama <i>Speedway</i> (1968). Frank and Nancy Sinatra played a fictional father and daughter in the 1965 comedy <i>Marriage on the Rocks</i>.

The band were a key part of the mid-1980s indie pop scene, but eventually moved away from their jangly sound, taking on more psychedelic and garage rock influences, before incorporating a dance music element to their sound with their 1991 album <i>Screamadelica</i>, which broke them into the mainstream. The band have continued to explore different styles on subsequent albums, experimenting with blues, trip hop and industrial rock. Their most recent album, <i>Chaosmosis</i>, was released on 18 March 2016.

</p><p>The band's name was taken from the song ""Ladytron"" by Roxy Music. Former Roxy Music member Brian Eno said in 2009, ""Ladytron are, for me, the best of English pop music. They're the kind of band that really only appears in England, with this funny mixture of eccentric art-school dicking around and dressing up, with a full awareness of what's happening everywhere musically, which is kind of knitted together and woven into something quite new."" Ladytron described their sound as ""electronic pop"", while music journalists have also described their sound as synth-pop, electronic rock, post-punk, and new wave, among other genres. Some of the group's songs contain lyrics written by Aroyo in her native Bulgarian.

<p><b>Samuel Cook</b> (January 22, 1931 – December 11, 1964), known professionally as <b>Sam Cooke</b>, was an American singer and songwriter. Considered to be a pioneer and one of the most influential soul artists of all time, Cooke is commonly referred to as the ""King of Soul"" for his distinctive vocals, notable contributions to the genre and significance in popular music.</p><p>Cooke was born in Clarksdale, Mississippi, and later relocated to Chicago with his family at a young age, where he began singing as a child and joined the Soul Stirrers as lead singer in the 1950s. Going solo in 1957, Cooke released a string of hit songs, including ""You Send Me"", ""A Change Is Gonna Come"", ""Cupid"", ""Wonderful World"", ""Chain Gang"", ""Twistin' the Night Away"", ""Bring It On Home to Me"", and ""Good Times"". During his eight-year career, Cooke released 29 singles that charted in the Top 40 of the <i>Billboard</i> Pop Singles chart, as well as 20 singles in the Top Ten of <i>Billboard</i><span>'s</span> Black Singles chart.
</p><p>In 1964, Cooke was shot and killed by the manager of a motel in Los Angeles. After an inquest and investigation, the courts ruled Cooke's death to be a justifiable homicide. His family has since questioned the circumstances of his death.
</p><p>Cooke's pioneering contributions to soul music contributed to the rise of Aretha Franklin, Bobby Womack, Al Green, Curtis Mayfield, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, and Billy Preston, and popularized the work of Otis Redding and James Brown. AllMusic biographer Bruce Eder wrote that Cooke was ""the inventor of soul music"", and possessed ""an incredible natural singing voice and a smooth, effortless delivery that has never been surpassed"".</p><p>Cooke was also a central part of the civil rights movement, using his influence and popularity with the White and Black populations to fight for the cause. He was friends with boxer Muhammad Ali, activist Malcolm X and football player Jim Brown, who together campaigned for racial equality.

</p>
<p><b>Jane's Addiction</b> is an American rock band from Los Angeles, formed in 1985. The band consists of vocalist Perry Farrell, guitarist Dave Navarro, drummer Stephen Perkins and bassist Eric Avery. Jane's Addiction was one of the first bands from the early 1990s alternative rock movement to gain both mainstream media attention and commercial success in the United States. 
</p><p>Founded by Farrell and Avery, following the disintegration of Farrell's previous band Psi Com, Jane's Addiction's first release was a self-titled live album, <i>Jane's Addiction</i> (1987), which caught the attention of Warner Bros. Records. The band's first two studio albums, <i>Nothing's Shocking</i> (1988) and <i>Ritual de lo Habitual</i> (1990), were released to widespread critical acclaim, and an increasing cult fanbase. As a result, Jane's Addiction became icons of what Farrell dubbed the ""Alternative Nation"". The band's initial farewell tour, in 1991, launched the first Lollapalooza, which has since become a perennial alternative rock festival.
</p><p>In 1997, the band reunited with Flea of the Red Hot Chili Peppers replacing Avery on bass guitar for a one-off tour. In 2001, a second reunion took place, with Martyn LeNoble—and later Chris Chaney—occupying the role of bass guitarist. In 2003, the band released its third studio album, <i>Strays</i>, before dissolving again the following year. In 2008, the band's original line-up reunited and embarked on a world tour. Avery acrimoniously left the band in early 2010, as the group began working on new material. In 2011, the band released its fourth studio album, <i>The Great Escape Artist</i>, with Chaney returning to the band for its recording and subsequent tour.
</p><p>Between the years of 2012 and 2022, the band remained active with occasional tours and performances honouring their legacy. In August 2022, Avery rejoined the band after a twelve-year absence, ahead of a joint tour with the Smashing Pumpkins. Due to ongoing struggles with long COVID, Navarro was replaced by Queens of the Stone Age guitarist Troy Van Leeuwen for the duration of the tour. As the three-piece of Farrell, Avery and Perkins began working on new material, Navarro remained absent from the band. Josh Klinghoffer was announced as his touring replacement in 2023 until at least April.

<p><b>My Morning Jacket</b> is an American rock band formed in Louisville, Kentucky in 1998. The band consists of vocalist/guitarist Jim James, bassist Tom Blankenship, drummer Patrick Hallahan, guitarist Carl Broemel, and keyboardist Bo Koster. The band's sound, rooted in rock and country, is often experimental and psychedelic. The group amassed a following beginning in the 2000s in part due to their live performances.
</p><p>The group first found success in Europe after the release of its debut album, <i>The Tennessee Fire</i> (1999). Its next release, <i>At Dawn</i> (2001), led to a large stateside following and preceded several lineup changes. After signing to major label ATO Records, the group released two albums, <i>It Still Moves</i> (2003) and <i>Z</i> (2005), with the latter representing a critical breakthrough. The group's next release, <i>Evil Urges</i> (2008), was more polarizing for fans and critics, while <i>Circuital</i> (2011), its sixth album, saw a more measured response. The band's seventh album, <i>The Waterfall</i>, was released in 2015, followed by <i>The Waterfall II</i> in 2020 and <i>My Morning Jacket</i> in 2021.

<p><b>Kamaljit Singh Jhooti</b> (born 26 March 1981), better known by the stage name <b>Jay Sean</b>, is a British singer and songwriter. He debuted in the UK's Asian Underground scene as a member of the Rishi Rich Project with ""Dance with You"", which reached No. 12 on the UK Singles Chart in 2003. This led to him being signed to Virgin Records and having two UK top 10 hits as a solo artist in 2004: ""Eyes on You"" at No. 6 and ""Stolen"" at #4. They were included in his critically acclaimed debut album <i>Me Against Myself</i> which, though only moderately successful in the UK, sold more than two million copies across Asia and remains his most successful album to date. Alongside the Rishi Rich Project, Sean was a pioneer of Bhangra-R&amp;B fusion, which his debut album helped popularize among the worldwide South Asian diaspora.</p><p>He eventually left Virgin in 2006 and founded his own independent label, Jayded Records. After a gap of nearly four years, he returned in 2008 with ""Ride It"", which reached No. 11 in the UK and topped the charts in several Eastern European countries, including Romania where it was one of the best-selling singles of the year. It was followed by hits such as ""Maybe"", which reached No. 7 on the Japan Hot 100, and ""Tonight"". They were included in his second album, <i>My Own Way</i>, which became his most successful album on the UK Albums Chart, reaching <span>No. 6</span>, and topped the UK R&amp;B Chart. At around this time, he began increasingly incorporating electropop sounds into his R&amp;B music.</p><p>From 2009 up to 2014, he was signed to Cash Money Records. In 2009, his American debut single ""Down"" topped the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100, making him the first solo artist of South Asian origin and first UK urban act to top the Hot 100. It was the seventh-best selling song of 2009, having sold more than three million copies in the United States that year, eventually reaching six million sales in the United States, making him the most successful British/European male urban artist in US chart history at the time. As of 2011, it is the fifth best selling song by a British artist in the digital era. It was soon followed by another hit, ""Do You Remember"", which has sold more than a million copies in the US, and entered the top ten on the Hot 100, making him the first male act since Chingy in 2003 to ""simultaneously appear in the Hot 100 top 10 with his first two charting singles."" They were included in his American-debut album <i>All or Nothing</i>, which debuted at No. 37 on the US <i>Billboard</i> 200 and reached No. 11 on the Japan Oricon Albums Chart.

</p><p>Born in Honolulu, Hawaiʻi, and raised in Louisville, Kentucky, Scherzinger began acting at the age of 14 and studied musical theatre at Wright State University. Aspiring to pursue a career in music, Scherzinger dropped out of college and toured with the American rock band Days of the New before finding modest success with Eden's Crush, a girl group created through The WB's <i>Popstars</i>. After taking on some minor acting roles, Scherzinger became the lead singer of the Pussycat Dolls. The prominence of her role in the group was a point of contention within it, and eventually contributed to its dissolution in 2009. Scherzinger has carved out a successful career outside the group. She shelved her first attempt with her debut album, <i>Her Name is Nicole</i>, but went on to release two studio albums (<i>Killer Love</i> in 2011 and <i>Big Fat Lie</i> in 2014) that were moderately successful. (<i>Killer Love</i> includes the hit singles ""Poison"", ""Right There"", and ""Don't Hold Your Breath"".)

The group is composed of Hillary Scott (lead and background vocals), Charles Kelley (lead and background vocals, guitar), and Dave Haywood (background vocals, guitar, piano, mandolin). Scott is the daughter of country music singer Linda Davis, and Kelley is the brother of pop singer Josh Kelley. The band abbreviated the name to ""Lady A"" in June 2020 during the George Floyd protests in an attempt to blunt the name's associations with slavery and the Antebellum South, inadvertently causing a dispute with black blues and gospel singer Anita White, who had been using the name Lady A for more than 20 years.
</p><p>The group made its debut in 2007 as guest vocalists on Jim Brickman's single ""Never Alone"", before signing to Capitol Nashville. Lady A has released six albums for Capitol: <i>Lady Antebellum</i>, <i>Need You Now</i>, <i>Own the Night</i>, <i>Golden</i>, <i>747</i>, <i>Heart Break</i>, plus one Christmas album (<i>On This Winter's Night</i>), and one for BMLG Records: <i>Ocean</i>. The first three albums are certified platinum or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The albums have produced sixteen singles on the Hot Country Songs and Country Airplay charts, of which nine have reached number one. The longest-lasting number one single is ""Need You Now"", which spent five weeks at that position in 2009; both that song and 2011's ""Just a Kiss"" reached number one on the Adult Contemporary charts.
</p><p>Lady A was awarded Top New Duo or Group by the Academy of Country Music and New Artist of the Year by the Country Music Association in 2008. The band was nominated for two Grammy Awards at the 51st Annual Grammy Awards and two more at the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards, winning Best Country Performance by Duo or Group with Vocals for ""I Run to You"". It was awarded Top Vocal Group, Song of the Year (""Need You Now""), and Single of the Year (""Need You Now"") at the 44th ACM Awards on April 18, 2010. It won five awards at the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards, including Song of the Year and Record of the Year for ""Need You Now"". At the 54th Annual Grammy Awards, Lady A won the award for Best Country Album for <i>Own the Night</i>. By August 2013, the group had sold more than 12.5 million digital singles and 10 million albums in the United States.</p>",Nashville

<p><b>Declan Patrick MacManus</b>  (born 25 August 1954), known professionally as <b>Elvis Costello</b>, is an English singer-songwriter and record producer. He has won multiple awards in his career, including a Grammy Award in 2020, and has twice been nominated for the Brit Award for Best British Male Artist. In 2003, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2004, <i>Rolling Stone</i> ranked Costello number 80 on its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.</p><p>Costello began his career as part of London's pub rock scene in the early 1970s and later became associated with the first wave of the British punk and new wave movement that emerged in the mid-to-late 1970s. His critically acclaimed debut album <i>My Aim Is True</i> was released in 1977. Shortly after recording it, he formed the Attractions as his backing band. His second album <i>This Year's Model</i> was released in 1978, and was ranked number 11 by <i>Rolling Stone</i> on its list of the best albums from 1967 to 1987. His third album <i>Armed Forces</i> was released in 1979, and features his highest-charting single, ""Oliver's Army"" (number 2 in the UK). His first three albums all appeared on <i>Rolling Stone</i><span>'</span>s list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time in 2003.
</p><p>Costello and the Attractions toured and recorded together for the better part of a decade, though differences between them caused a split by 1986. Much of Costello's work since has been as a solo artist, though reunions with members of the Attractions have been credited to the group over the years. Costello's lyrics employ a wide vocabulary and frequent wordplay. His music has drawn on many diverse genres; one critic described him as a ""pop encyclopaedia"", able to ""reinvent the past in his own image"".  Since 2002, his touring band (featuring a rotating cast of musicians) has been known as the Imposters.
</p><p>Costello has co-written several original songs for films, including ""God Give Me Strength"" from <i>Grace of My Heart</i> (1996, with Burt Bacharach) and ""The Scarlet Tide"" from <i>Cold Mountain</i> (2003, with T-Bone Burnett). For the latter, Elvis was nominated (along with Burnett) for the Academy Award for Best Original Song and the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media.

</p>
<p><b>Willie Hugh Nelson</b> (born April 29, 1933) is an American singer, songwriter, musician, political activist and actor. He was one of the main figures of outlaw country, a subgenre of country music that developed in the late 1960s as a reaction to the conservative restrictions of the Nashville sound. The critical success of his album <i>Shotgun Willie</i> (1973), combined with the critical and commercial success of <i>Red Headed Stranger</i> (1975) and <i>Stardust</i> (1978), made Nelson one of the most recognized artists in country music. Nelson has acted in over 30 films, co-authored several books, and has been involved in activism for the use of biofuels and the legalization of marijuana.
</p><p>Born during the Great Depression and raised by his grandparents, Nelson wrote his first song at age seven and joined his first band at ten. During high school, he toured locally with the Bohemian Polka as their lead singer and guitar player. After graduating from high school in 1950, he joined the U.S. Air Force but was later discharged due to back problems. After his return, Nelson attended Baylor University for two years but dropped out because he was succeeding in music. He worked as a disc jockey at radio stations in his native Texas, and in several radio stations in the Pacific Northwest, all the while working as a singer and songwriter throughout the late 1950s. During that time, he wrote songs that would become country standards, including ""Funny How Time Slips Away"", ""Hello Walls"", ""Pretty Paper"", and ""Crazy"". In 1960 he moved to Nashville, Tennessee, and later signed a publishing contract with Pamper Music which allowed him to join Ray Price's band as a bassist. In 1962, he recorded his first album, <i>...And Then I Wrote</i>. Due to this success, Nelson signed in 1964 with RCA Victor and joined the Grand Ole Opry the following year. After mid-chart hits in the late 1960s and the early 1970s, Nelson grew weary of the corporate Nashville music scene, and in 1972 he moved to Austin, Texas. The ongoing music scene of Austin motivated Nelson to return to performing, appearing frequently at the Armadillo World Headquarters.
</p><p>In 1973, after signing with Atlantic Records, Nelson turned to outlaw country, including albums such as <i>Shotgun Willie</i> and <i>Phases and Stages</i>. In 1975, he switched to Columbia Records, where he recorded the critically acclaimed album <i>Red Headed Stranger</i>. The same year, he recorded another outlaw country album, <i>Wanted! The Outlaws</i>, along with Waylon Jennings, Jessi Colter, and Tompall Glaser. During the mid-1980s, while creating hit albums like <i>Honeysuckle Rose</i> and recording hit songs like ""On the Road Again"", ""To All the Girls I've Loved Before"", and ""Pancho and Lefty"", he joined the country supergroup The Highwaymen, along with fellow singers Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, and Kris Kristofferson. In 1985, he helped organize the first Farm Aid concert to benefit American farmers; the concerts have been held annually ever since and Nelson has been a fixture, appearing at every one.
</p><p>In 1990, Nelson's assets were seized by the Internal Revenue Service, which claimed that he owed $32<span> </span>million. The difficulty of paying his outstanding debt was aggravated by weak investments he had made during the 1980s. In 1992, Nelson released <i>The IRS Tapes: Who'll Buy My Memories?</i>; the profits of the double album—destined to the IRS—and the auction of Nelson's assets cleared his debt. During the 1990s and 2000s, Nelson continued touring extensively, and released albums every year. Reviews ranged from positive to mixed. He explored genres such as reggae, blues, jazz, and folk.
</p><p>Nelson made his first movie appearance in the 1979 film <i>The Electric Horseman</i>, followed by other appearances in movies and on television. Nelson is a major liberal activist and the co-chair of the advisory board of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML), which is in favor of marijuana legalization. On the environmental front, Nelson owns the biodiesel brand Willie Nelson Biodiesel, whose product is made from vegetable oil. Nelson is also the honorary chairman of the advisory board of the Texas Music Project, the official music charity of the state of Texas.

<p><b>Herbert Jeffrey Hancock</b> (born April 12, 1940) is an American jazz pianist, keyboardist, bandleader, and composer. Hancock started his career with trumpeter Donald Byrd's group. He shortly thereafter joined the Miles Davis Quintet, where he helped to redefine the role of a jazz rhythm section and was one of the primary architects of the post-bop sound. In the 1970s, Hancock experimented with jazz fusion, funk, and electro styles, utilizing a wide array of synthesizers and electronics. It was during this period that he released perhaps his best-known and most influential album, <i>Head Hunters</i>.</p><p>Hancock's best-known compositions include ""Cantaloupe Island"", ""Watermelon Man"", ""Maiden Voyage"", and ""Chameleon"", all of which are jazz standards. During the 1980s, he enjoyed a hit single with the electronic instrumental ""Rockit"", a collaboration with bassist/producer Bill Laswell. Hancock has won an Academy Award and 14 Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year for his 2007 Joni Mitchell tribute album <i>River: The Joni Letters</i>, becoming only the second jazz album to win the award after <i>Getz/Gilberto</i> in 1965.
</p><p>Since 2012, Hancock has served as a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, where he teaches at the UCLA Herb Alpert School of Music. He is also the chairman of the Herbie Hancock Institute of Jazz (formerly known as the Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz until 2019).

<p><b>Thin Lizzy</b> are an Irish hard rock band formed in Dublin in 1969. Their music reflects a wide range of influences, including blues, soul music, psychedelic rock and traditional Irish folk music, but is generally classified as hard rock or sometimes heavy metal.
</p><p>Two of the founding members, drummer Brian Downey and bass guitarist, lead vocalist and principal songwriter Phil Lynott, met while still in school. Lynott led the group throughout their recording career of twelve studio albums, writing most of the material. The singles ""Whiskey in the Jar"" (a traditional Irish ballad), ""The Boys Are Back in Town"" and ""Waiting for an Alibi"" were international hits. After Lynott's death in 1986, various incarnations of the band emerged over the years based initially around guitarists Scott Gorham and John Sykes, though Sykes left the band in 2009. Gorham later continued with a new line-up including Downey. In 2012, Gorham and Downey decided against recording new material as Thin Lizzy so a new band, Black Star Riders, was formed to tour and produce new releases, such as their debut album <i>All Hell Breaks Loose</i>. Thin Lizzy have since reunited for occasional concerts.</p><p>Lynott, Thin Lizzy's <i>de facto</i> leader, was composer or co-composer of almost all of the band's songs, and the first Black Irishman to achieve commercial success in the field of rock music. Thin Lizzy featured several guitarists throughout their history, with Downey and Lynott as the rhythm section, on the drums and bass guitar. As well as being multiracial, the band drew their early members not only from both sides of the Irish border but also from both the Catholic and Protestant communities during The Troubles.
</p><p><i>Rolling Stone</i> magazine describes the band as distinctly hard rock, ""far apart from the braying mid-70s metal pack"". AllMusic critic John Dougan has written that ""As the band's creative force, Lynott was a more insightful and intelligent writer than many of his ilk, preferring slice-of-life working-class dramas of love and hate influenced by Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen and virtually all of the Irish literary tradition.""</p>",Dublin

<p><b>(Achille) Claude Debussy</b> (<small>French: </small><span title=""Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)"" lang=""fr-Latn-fonipa"">[aʃil klod dəbysi]</span>; 22 August 1862 – 25 March 1918) was a French composer. He is sometimes seen as the first Impressionist composer, although he vigorously rejected the term. He was among the most influential composers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
</p><p>Born to a family of modest means and little cultural involvement, Debussy showed enough musical talent to be admitted at the age of ten to France's leading music college, the Conservatoire de Paris. He originally studied the piano, but found his vocation in innovative composition, despite the disapproval of the Conservatoire's conservative professors. He took many years to develop his mature style, and was nearly 40 when he achieved international fame in 1902 with the only opera he completed, <i>Pelléas et Mélisande</i>.
</p><p>Debussy's orchestral works include <i>Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune</i> (1894), <i>Nocturnes</i> (1897–1899) and <i>Images</i> (1905–1912). His music was to a considerable extent a reaction against Wagner and the German musical tradition. He regarded the classical symphony as obsolete and sought an alternative in his ""symphonic sketches"", <i>La mer</i> (1903–1905). His piano works include sets of 24 Préludes and 12 Études. Throughout his career he wrote <i>mélodies</i> based on a wide variety of poetry, including his own. He was greatly influenced by the Symbolist poetic movement of the later 19th century. A small number of works, including the early <i>La Damoiselle élue</i> and the late <i>Le Martyre de saint Sébastien</i> have important parts for chorus. In his final years, he focused on chamber music, completing three of six planned sonatas for different combinations of instruments.
</p><p>With early influences including Russian and Far Eastern music, Debussy developed his own style of harmony and orchestral colouring, derided – and unsuccessfully resisted – by much of the musical establishment of the day. His works have strongly influenced a wide range of composers including Béla Bartók, Olivier Messiaen, George Benjamin, and the jazz pianist and composer Bill Evans. Debussy died from cancer at his home in Paris at the age of 55 after a composing career of a little more than 30 years.

<p><b>Riley B. King</b> (September 16, 1925 – May 14, 2015), known professionally as <b>B.B. King</b>, was an American blues singer-songwriter, guitarist, and record producer. He introduced a sophisticated style of soloing based on fluid string bending, shimmering vibrato, and staccato picking that influenced many later blues electric guitar players. AllMusic recognized King as ""the single most important electric guitarist of the last half of the 20th century"".</p><p>King was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987 and is one of the most influential blues musicians of all time, earning the nickname ""The King of the Blues"", and is considered one of the ""Three Kings of the Blues Guitar"" (along with Albert King and Freddie King, none of whom are related). King performed tirelessly throughout his musical career, appearing on average at more than 200 concerts per year into his 70s. In 1956 alone, he appeared at 342 shows.</p><p>King was born on a cotton plantation of Berclair near the city of Itta Bena, Mississippi, and later worked at a cotton gin in Indianola, Mississippi. He was attracted to music and the guitar in church and began his career in juke joints and local radio. He later lived in Memphis and Chicago; then, as his fame grew, he toured the world extensively. King died at 89 in Las Vegas on May 14, 2015.

<p><b>Violent Femmes</b> are an American folk punk band from Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The band consists of founding members Gordon Gano (guitar, lead vocals) and Brian Ritchie (bass, backing vocals), joined by multi-instrumentalist Blaise Garza (joined 2004), and drummer John Sparrow (joined 2005). Former members of the band include drummers Victor DeLorenzo (1980–1993, 2002–2013), Guy Hoffman (1993–2002), and Brian Viglione (2013–2016). 
</p><p>Violent Femmes have released ten studio albums and 15 singles during the course of their career. The band found critical acclaim with the release of their self-titled debut album in early 1983. Featuring many of their best-known songs, including ""Blister in the Sun"", ""Kiss Off"", ""Add It Up"" and ""Gone Daddy Gone"", <i>Violent Femmes</i> became the band's biggest-selling album and was eventually certified platinum by the RIAA. After the release of their third album <i>The Blind Leading the Naked</i> (1986), the band's future was uncertain and they split up in 1987 when Gano and Ritchie went solo. However, they regrouped a year later, releasing their fourth album <i>3</i> (1989). The follow-up album, <i>Why Do Birds Sing?</i> (1991), contains the fan favorite and concert staple ""American Music"".
</p><p>In 1993, founding member Victor DeLorenzo (percussion, snare drum) left Violent Femmes and was replaced by Guy Hoffman, who debuted on the band's sixth album <i>New Times</i> (1994). Two more albums – <i>Rock!!!!!</i> (1995) and <i>Freak Magnet</i> (2000) – were released with this lineup before DeLorenzo rejoined the band in 2002 for what was to be a farewell tour. Following the commercial failure of <i>Freak Magnet</i>, Violent Femmes did not release any more studio albums for almost two decades, although a number of compilation albums were released in the early 2000s, along with a few one-off songs. Some controversy over the licensing of the band's songs for commercial use led to an official break-up in 2009, though they re-formed in 2013 (shortly before DeLorenzo left Violent Femmes again), and have since released two more studio albums of new material: <i>We Can Do Anything</i> (2016) and <i>Hotel Last Resort</i> (2019).

</p>
<p><b>The Isley Brothers</b> (<span></span> <i title=""English pronunciation respelling""><span>EYEZ</span>-lee</i>) are an American musical group originally from Cincinnati, Ohio, that began as a vocal trio consisting of brothers O'Kelly ""Kelly"" Isley Jr., Rudolph Isley and Ronald Isley in the 1950s. With a career spanning over seven decades, the group has enjoyed one of the ""longest, most influential, and most diverse careers in the pantheon of popular music"".</p><p>Together with a fourth brother, Vernon, the group performed gospel music until Vernon's death a few years after its formation. After moving to New York City in the late 1950s, the group had their first successes during these early years, and rose to prominence in 1959 with their fourth single, ""Shout"", written by the three brothers, which became their first single to chart on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100, and sold over a million copies. In the 1960s, the group recorded songs for a variety of labels, including the top 20 single ""Twist and Shout"" and the Motown single ""This Old Heart of Mine (Is Weak for You)"", before recording and releasing the Grammy Award-winning hit ""It's Your Thing"" on their own label, T-Neck Records.
</p><p>The inclusion of younger brothers Ernie Isley (lead guitar, drums) and Marvin Isley (bass guitar), and Rudolph's brother-in-law Chris Jasper (keyboards, synthesizers), in 1973 turned the original vocal trio into a complete band and led to the group’s reaching the height of their success. For the next full decade, they recorded a string of top-selling albums including <i>3 + 3</i>, <i>Between the Sheets</i>, and <i>The Heat Is On</i>, with the latter peaking at number one on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 chart. The six-member band splintered in 1983, with Ernie, Marvin, and Chris Jasper forming the short-lived spinoff group Isley-Jasper-Isley. The oldest member, O'Kelly, died in 1986. Afterwards Rudolph and Ronald released a pair of albums as a duo before Rudolph retired to a life in the Christian ministry in 1989. After multiple lineup changes, the remaining duo of Ronald and Ernie achieved mainstream success with the albums <i>Mission to Please</i> (1996), <i>Eternal</i> (2001) and <i>Body Kiss</i> (2003). <i>Eternal</i> spawned the top 20 hit ""Contagious"". As of 2021, the Isley Brothers continue to perform under the lineup of Ronald and Ernie.
</p><p>The Isley Brothers have sold over 18 million units in the United States alone. With their first major hit charting in 1959 (""Shout""), and their last one in 2001 (""Contagious""), they are among the few groups ever to have hit the Billboard Hot 100 with new music in six different decades. Sixteen of their albums charted in the Top 40 and thirteen of those albums have been certified gold, platinum or multi-platinum by the RIAA. The brothers have been honored by several musical institutions, including the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, which inducted them in 1992. Five years later, they were added to Hollywood's Rockwalk, and in 2003 they were inducted to the Vocal Group Hall of Fame. They received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2014.</p>

</p>
<p><b>Anthony Dominick Benedetto</b> (born August 3, 1926), known professionally as <b>Tony Bennett</b>, is an American retired singer of traditional pop standards, big band, show tunes, and jazz. Bennett is also a painter, having created works under his birth name that are on permanent public display in several institutions. He is the founder of the Frank Sinatra School of the Arts in Astoria, Queens, New York. Bennett has amassed numerous accolades throughout his career, including 20 Grammy Awards (including a Lifetime Achievement Award presented in 2001) and two Primetime Emmy Awards. He was named an NEA Jazz Master and a Kennedy Center Honoree. Bennett has sold over 50 million records worldwide.
</p><p>Bennett began singing at an early age. He fought in the final stages of World War II as a U.S. Army infantryman in the European Theater. Afterward, he developed his singing technique, signed with Columbia Records and had his first number-one popular song with ""Because of You"" in 1951. Several tracks such as ""Rags to Riches"" followed in early 1953. He then refined his approach to encompass jazz singing. He reached an artistic peak in the late 1950s with albums such as <i>The Beat of My Heart</i> and <i>Basie Swings, Bennett Sings</i>. In 1962, Bennett recorded his signature song, ""I Left My Heart in San Francisco"". His career and personal life experienced an extended downturn during the height of the rock music era. Bennett staged a comeback in the late 1980s and 1990s, putting out gold record albums again and expanding his reach to the MTV generation while keeping his musical style intact.
</p><p>Bennett continued to create popular and critically praised work into the 21st century. He attracted acclaim for his collaborations with Lady Gaga, which began with the album <i>Cheek to Cheek</i> (2014); the two performers toured together to promote the album throughout 2014 and 2015. With the release of the duo's second album, <i>Love for Sale</i> (2021), Bennett broke the individual record for the longest span of top-10 albums on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 chart for any living artist; his first top-10 record was <i>I Left My Heart in San Francisco</i> in 1962. Bennett also broke the Guinness World Record for the oldest person to release an album of new material, at the age of 95 years and 60 days.
</p><p>In February 2021, it was revealed that Bennett was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2016. Due to the slow progression of his illness, he continued to record, tour, and perform until his retirement from concerts due to physical challenges, which was announced after his final performances on August 3 and 5, 2021, at Radio City Music Hall.</p>

<p><b>Kraftwerk</b> (<small>German: </small><span title=""Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)"" lang=""de-Latn-fonipa"">[ˈkʁaftvɛɐ̯k]</span>, <abbr style=""font-size:85%"" title=""literal translation"">lit.</abbr> ""power station"") is a German band formed in Düsseldorf in 1970 by Ralf Hütter and Florian Schneider. Widely considered innovators and pioneers of electronic music, Kraftwerk were among the first successful acts to popularize the genre. The group began as part of West Germany's experimental krautrock scene in the early 1970s before fully embracing electronic instrumentation, including synthesizers, drum machines, and vocoders. Wolfgang Flür joined the band in 1974 and Karl Bartos in 1975, expanding the band to a quartet.
</p><p>On commercially successful albums such as <i>Autobahn</i> (1974), <i>Trans-Europe Express</i> (1977), <i>The Man-Machine</i> (1978), and <i>Computer World</i> (1981), Kraftwerk developed a self-described ""robot pop"" style that combined electronic music with pop melodies, sparse arrangements, and repetitive rhythms, while adopting a stylized image including matching suits. Following the release of <i>Electric Café</i> (1986), Flür left the group in 1987, followed by Bartos in 1990. Founding member Schneider left in 2008.
</p><p>The band's work has influenced a diverse range of artists and many genres of modern music, including synth-pop, hip hop, post-punk, techno, house music, ambient, and club music. In 2014, the Recording Academy honoured Kraftwerk with a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. They later won the Grammy Award for Best Dance/Electronic Album with their live album <i>3-D The Catalogue</i> (2017) at the 2018 ceremony. In 2021, Kraftwerk was inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in the early influence category. As of 2022, the band continues to tour, with the members' live performances celebrating Kraftwerk's fiftieth anniversary.</p>

Emerging from the new wave scene in the late 1970s, they consisted of Ric Ocasek (rhythm guitar), Benjamin Orr (bass guitar), Elliot Easton (lead guitar), Greg Hawkes (keyboards), and David Robinson (drums). Ocasek and Orr shared lead vocals, and Ocasek was the band's principal songwriter and leader.
</p><p>The Cars were at the forefront of the merger of 1970s guitar-oriented rock with the new synthesizer-oriented pop that became popular in the early 1980s. Robert Palmer, music critic for <i>The New York Times</i> and <i>Rolling Stone</i>, described the Cars' musical style: ""They have taken some important but disparate contemporary trends—punk minimalism, the labyrinthine synthesizer and guitar textures of art rock, the '50s rockabilly revival and the melodious terseness of power pop—and mixed them into a personal and appealing blend.""</p><p>The Cars were named Best New Artist in the 1978 <i>Rolling Stone</i> Readers' Poll. The band's debut album, <i>The Cars</i>, sold six million copies and appeared on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 album chart for 139 weeks. The Cars had four Top 10 hits: ""Shake It Up"" (1981), ""You Might Think"" (1984), ""Drive"" (1984), and ""Tonight She Comes"" (1985). The band won Video of the Year for ""You Might Think"" at the first MTV Video Music Awards in 1984. 
</p><p>The Cars disbanded in 1988. Orr died in 2000 from pancreatic cancer. In 2007, Easton and Hawkes joined Todd Rundgren and others to form the offshoot band The New Cars. The surviving original members of the Cars reunited in 2010 to record the band's seventh and final album, <i>Move Like This</i>, which was released in May 2011. Following a short tour in support of <i>Move Like This</i>, the band once again went on hiatus. In April 2018, the Cars were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and reunited to perform at the induction ceremony.

<p><b>Hole</b> was an American alternative rock band formed in Los Angeles, California, in 1989. It was founded by singer Courtney Love and guitarist Eric Erlandson. It had several different bassists and drummers, the most prolific being drummer Patty Schemel, and bassists Kristen Pfaff (d. 1994) and Melissa Auf der Maur. Hole released a total of four studio albums between two incarnations spanning the 1990s and early-2010s and became one of the most commercially successful rock bands in history fronted by a woman.</p><p>Influenced by Los Angeles' punk rock scene, the band's debut album, <i>Pretty on the Inside</i> (1991), was produced by Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth, and attracted critical interest from British and American alternative press. Their second album, <i>Live Through This</i>, released 1994 by DGC Records,  which featured less aggressive melodies and more restrained lyrical content, was widely acclaimed and reached platinum status within a year of its release. Their third album, <i>Celebrity Skin</i> (1998), marked a notable departure from their earlier punk influences, boasting a more commercially viable sound; the album sold around 2 million copies worldwide, and earned them significant critical acclaim.
</p><p>They disbanded in 2002, and the members individually pursued other projects. Eight years later in 2010, Hole was reformed by Love with new members, despite Erlandson's claim that the reformation breached a mutual contract he had with her. The reformed band released the album <i>Nobody's Daughter</i> (2010), which was conceived as Love's second solo album. In 2013, Love retired the Hole name, releasing new material and touring as a solo artist.
</p><p>Hole received several accolades, including four Grammy Award nominations. They were also commercially successful, selling over three million records in the United States alone, and had a far-reaching influence on contemporary female artists. Music and feminist scholars have also recognized the band as the most high-profile musical group of the 1990s to discuss gender issues in their songs, due to Love's aggressive and violent lyrical content, which often addressed themes of body image, abuse, and sexual exploitation.

</p>
<p><b>Buffalo Springfield</b> was a rock band formed in Los Angeles by Canadian musicians Neil Young, Bruce Palmer and Dewey Martin and American musicians Stephen Stills and Richie Furay. The group, widely known for the song ""For What It's Worth"", released three albums and several singles from 1966 to 1968. Their music combined elements of folk music and country music with British Invasion and psychedelic rock influences. Like contemporary band the Byrds, they were key to the early development of folk rock. The band took their name from a steamroller parked outside their house.
</p><p>Buffalo Springfield formed in Los Angeles in 1966 with Stills (guitar, keyboards, vocals), Martin (drums, vocals), Palmer (bass guitar), Furay (guitar, vocals) and Young (guitar, harmonica, piano, vocals). The band signed to Atlantic Records in 1966 and released their debut single ""Nowadays Clancy Can't Even Sing"", which became a hit in Los Angeles. The following January, they released the protest song ""For What It's Worth"", which became their only US top 10 hit and a counterculture anthem. Their second album, <i>Buffalo Springfield Again</i>, marked their progression to psychedelia and hard rock and featured other well-known songs such as ""Bluebird"" and ""Mr. Soul"".
</p><p>After several drug-related arrests and line-up changes, the group disbanded in 1968. Their third and final album, <i>Last Time Around</i>, was compiled and released shortly after their dissolution. Stephen Stills went on to form the supergroup Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash with David Crosby of the Byrds and Graham Nash of the Hollies. Neil Young launched his solo career and later joined Stills in Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young in 1969. Furay, along with Jim Messina, went on to form the country-rock band Poco. Buffalo Springfield was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997, and briefly reunited for a comeback tour in 2011.

<p><b>Collective Soul</b> is an American rock band originally from Stockbridge, Georgia. Now based in Atlanta, the group consists of lead vocalist Ed Roland, rhythm guitarist Dean Roland, bassist Will Turpin, drummer Johnny Rabb, and lead guitarist Jesse Triplett. Formed in 1992, the original lineup consisted of the Roland brothers, Turpin, guitarist Ross Childress, and drummer Shane Evans. Collective Soul released their <i>Hints, Allegations, and Things Left Unsaid</i> album on the independent label Rising Storm Records in 1993. The band went from obscurity to popularity that year after the album's lead single ""Shine"" received regional radio play. The album was then re-released in 1994 by the major label Atlantic Records; thus, ""Shine"" became a national hit as it peaked at No. 1 on the Mainstream Rock and No. 4 on the Mainstream Top 40 charts.
</p><p>Collective Soul released a self-titled album in March 1995. Considered by Ed Roland to be the band's true debut album, <i>Collective Soul</i> spent 76 weeks on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 charts and went triple-platinum, becoming the band's highest-selling album. The singles ""December"", ""The World I Know"", and ""Where the River Flows"" each reached No. 1 on the Mainstream Rock charts. About two years later, Collective Soul released <i>Disciplined Breakdown</i>. Although not as successful in sales as their previous two albums, <i>Disciplined Breakdown</i> contained two No. 1 Mainstream Rock chart hits with ""Precious Declaration"" and ""Listen"". The band released a fourth studio album, <i>Dosage</i>, in 1999. The album's first single, ""Heavy"",  spent a then record-breaking 15 weeks on the top spot of the Mainstream Rock charts.
</p><p>The band released <i>Blender</i> in 2000, their fifth and final album with the original starting lineup, as lead guitarist Childress left the band in 2001. About two weeks after Childress' departure, Collective Soul released <i>Seven Year Itch</i>, a compilation of their greatest hits between 1994 and 2001. Collective Soul established their own label, El Music Group, prior to releasing <i>Youth</i> in 2004. Original drummer Evans then departed from the band at the end of 2005. Collective Soul has since released five more albums: <i>Afterwords</i> (2007), a second self-titled album (2009), <i>See What You Started by Continuing</i> (2015), <i>Blood</i> (2019), and <i>Vibrating</i> (2022).

</p><p>To date, Rancid has released nine studio albums, one split album, one compilation, two extended plays, and a series of live online-only albums, and has been featured on a number of compilation albums. The band has sold over four million records worldwide, making it one of the most successful punk rock groups of all time. The band rose to fame in 1994 with its second studio album, <i>Let's Go</i>, featuring the single ""Salvation"".

<p><b>The Human League</b> are an English synth-pop band formed in Sheffield in 1977. Initially an experimental electronic outfit, the group signed to Virgin Records in 1979 and later attained widespread commercial success with their third album <i>Dare</i> in 1981 after restructuring their lineup. The album contained four hit singles, including the UK/US number one hit ""Don't You Want Me"". The band received the Brit Award for Best British Breakthrough Act in 1982. Further hits followed throughout the 1980s and into the 1990s, including ""Mirror Man"", ""(Keep Feeling) Fascination"", ""The Lebanon"", ""Human"" (a second US No. 1) and ""Tell Me When"".
</p><p>The only constant band member since 1977 has been lead singer and songwriter Philip Oakey. Keyboard players Martyn Ware and Ian Craig Marsh both left the band in 1980 to form Heaven 17. Under Oakey's leadership, the Human League then evolved into a commercially successful new pop band, with a new line-up including female vocalists Joanne Catherall and Susan Ann Sulley. Since the mid-1990s, the band have essentially been a trio of Oakey, Catherall and Sulley with various sidemen.
</p><p>Since 1978, the Human League have released 9 studio albums, a remix album, a live album, 6 EPs, 29 singles and 13 compilation albums. They have had 6 Top 20 albums and 13 Top 20 singles in the UK and had sold more than 20 million records worldwide by 2010. As an early techno-pop act that received extensive MTV airplay, they are regarded as one of the leading artists of the 1980s Second British Invasion of the US.</p>",Sheffield

<p><b>My Bloody Valentine</b> (often stylised in all lowercase) is an Irish-English rock band formed in Dublin in 1983 and consisting since 1987 of founding members Kevin Shields (vocals, guitar, sampler), Colm Ó Cíosóig (drums, sampler) with Bilinda Butcher (vocals, guitar) and Debbie Googe (bass). Their music is characterized by dissonant guitar textures, androgynous vocals, and unorthodox production techniques. They are credited with pioneering the 1990s genre shoegaze.
</p><p>Following several unsuccessful early releases and membership changes, My Bloody Valentine signed to Creation Records in 1988. The band released several successful EPs and the albums <i>Isn't Anything</i> (1988) and <i>Loveless</i> (1991) on the label; the latter is often described as their magnum opus and one of the best rock albums of the 1990s. However, My Bloody Valentine were dropped by Creation after its release due to the album's extensive production costs. In 1992, the band signed to Island Records and recorded several albums worth of unreleased material, remaining largely inactive.
</p><p>Googe and Ó Cíosóig left the band in 1995, and were followed by Butcher in 1997. Unable to complete a follow-up to <i>Loveless</i>, Shields isolated himself and, in his own words, ""went crazy"". In 2007, My Bloody Valentine reunited and subsequently embarked on a world tour. They released the compilation <i>EP's 1988-1991</i> in 2012. Their long-delayed third studio album, <span><i>m b v</i></span>, was released in 2013 and supported by further touring.

</p><p>According to Jon Foreman, the name ""Switchfoot"" comes from a surfing term. ""We all love to surf and have been surfing all our lives so to us, the name made sense. To switch your feet means to take a new stance facing the opposite direction. It's about change and movement, a different way of approaching life and music.""</p>",San Diego

The band formed in 2002 and was active until 2008, when Weiland left the band abruptly to rejoin Stone Temple Pilots.
</p><p>In 2004, the band achieved commercial success with their debut album, <i>Contraband</i>. Despite positive reviews, some critics initially described Velvet Revolver as a mere combination of Stone Temple Pilots and Guns N' Roses, and criticizing them for a ""disconnection"" between Weiland and the rest of the band. With their single ""Slither"", they won the 2005 Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance. The band released <i>Libertad</i> in 2007, driven by the release of the single ""She Builds Quick Machines"", and embarked on a tour with Alice in Chains.
</p><p>In April 2008, Weiland was fired from Velvet Revolver and reunited with Stone Temple Pilots. Velvet Revolver was put on indefinite hiatus and in November of that year, requested to be released by their record label RCA Records to allow themselves ""complete freedom to go through whatever process it would take to accomplish"" replacing Weiland.
</p><p>Although Velvet Revolver worked on new material and auditioned new singers following Scott Weiland's departure, the band has not released any new material and only performed publicly once since 2008, when they reunited with Weiland for a one-off reunion show on January 12, 2012, at a benefit concert. This proved to be their last performance together before Weiland's death on December 3, 2015. Slash and McKagan later rejoined Guns N' Roses in 2016.

</p>
<p><b>Diana Ross</b> (born March 26, 1944), is an American singer and actress. She rose to fame as the lead singer of the vocal group The Supremes, who became Motown's most successful act during the 1960s and one of the world's best-selling girl groups of all time. They remain the best-charting female group in 
history, with a total of twelve number-one hit singles on the US <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100, including ""Where Did Our Love Go"", ""Baby Love"", ""Come See About Me"", and ""Love Child"".</p><p>Following departure from the Supremes in 1970, Ross embarked on a successful solo career in music, film, television and on stage. Her eponymous debut solo album featured the U.S. number-one hit ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"" and music anthem ""Reach Out and Touch (Somebody's Hand)"".  It was followed with her second solo album, <i>Everything Is Everything</i> (1970), which spawned her first UK number-one single ""I'm Still Waiting"". She continued her successful solo career by mounting elaborate record-setting world-wide concert tours, starring in a number of highly watched prime-time television specials, and releasing hit albums like <i>Touch Me in the Morning</i> (1973), <i>Mahogany</i> (1975), and <i>Diana Ross</i> (1976) as well as their number-one hit singles, ""Touch Me in the Morning"", ""Theme from Mahogany (Do You Know Where You're Going To)"", and ""Love Hangover"", respectively. Ross further released numerous top-ten hits on various <i>Billboard</i> charts throughout the 1970s, '80s, and '90s. She achieved several more global number-one singles, ""Upside Down"" (1980), ""Endless Love"" (1981), ""Why Do Fools Fall in Love"" (1982), ""Chain Reaction"" (1986), ""If We Hold on Together"" (1988) and  ""When You Tell Me That You Love Me"" (1991).
</p><p>Ross has also achieved mainstream success and recognition as an actor. Her first role was her Golden Globe Award-winning and Academy Award-nominated portrayal of Billie Holiday in the film <i>Lady Sings the Blues</i> (1972); she also recorded its soundtrack, which became a number one hit on the U.S. album chart. She also starred in two other feature films, <i>Mahogany</i> (1975) and <i>The Wiz</i> (1978), and later appeared in the television films <i>Out of Darkness</i> (1994), for which she was nominated for a Golden Globe Award, and <i>Double Platinum</i> (1999).
</p><p>Ross was named the ""Female Entertainer of the Century"" by <i>Billboard</i> in 1976. Since her solo career began in 1970, Ross has released 25 studio albums, numerous singles, and compilations that have sold more than 100 million records worldwide. She is the only female artist to have had number-one singles on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 as a solo artist, as the other half of a duet, as a member of a trio, and as an ensemble member. In 2021, <i>Billboard</i> ranked her the 30th greatest Hot 100 artist of all time. Her hits as a Supreme and a solo artist combined put  Ross among the Top 5 artists on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 singles chart from 1955 to 2018. She had a top 10 UK hit in every one of the last five decades, and sang lead on a top 75 hit single at least once every year from 1964 to 1996 in the UK, a period of 33 consecutive years and a record for any performer. In 1988, Ross was inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Supremes, and is one of the rare performers to have two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. She was the recipient of a Special Tony Award in 1976, the Kennedy Center Honors in 2007, the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2012 and 2023 (the latter as a member of The Supremes), and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016.

</p>
<p>The <b>Grateful Dead</b> was an American rock band formed in 1965 in Palo Alto, California. The band is known for its eclectic style, which fused elements of rock, folk, country, jazz, bluegrass, blues, rock and roll, gospel, reggae, world music, and psychedelia; for live performances of lengthy instrumental jams that typically incorporated modal and tonal improvisation; and for its devoted fan base, known as ""Deadheads"". According to Lenny Kaye, ""their music touches on ground that most other groups don't even know exists."" These various influences were distilled into a diverse and psychedelic whole that made the Grateful Dead ""the pioneering Godfathers of the jam band world"".</p><p>The band was ranked 57th by <i>Rolling Stone</i> magazine in its ""The Greatest Artists of All Time"" issue. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and a recording of their May 8, 1977 performance at Cornell University's Barton Hall was added to the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress in 2012. Despite having only one top-40 single in their 30-year career, ""Touch of Grey"", the Grateful Dead remained among the highest-grossing American touring acts for multiple decades and gained a committed fanbase by word of mouth and the exchange of live recordings due to the band's permissive stance on taping.
</p><p>The Grateful Dead was founded in the San Francisco Bay Area amid the rise of the counterculture of the 1960s. The founding members were Jerry Garcia (lead guitar, vocals), Bob Weir (rhythm guitar, vocals), Ron ""Pigpen"" McKernan (keyboards, harmonica, vocals), Phil Lesh (bass, vocals), and Bill Kreutzmann (drums). Members of the Grateful Dead, originally known as the Warlocks, had played together in various Bay Area ensembles, including the traditional jug band Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions. Lesh was the last member to join the Warlocks before they changed their name to the Grateful Dead; replacing Dana Morgan Jr., who had played bass for a few gigs. Drummer Mickey Hart and non-performing lyricist Robert Hunter joined in 1967. With the exception of McKernan, who died in 1973, and Hart, who took time off from 1971 to 1974, the core of the band stayed together for its entire 30-year history. The other official members of the band are Tom Constanten (keyboards; 1968–1970), John Perry Barlow (non-performing lyricist; 1971–1995), Keith Godchaux (keyboards, occasional vocals; 1971–1979), Donna Godchaux (vocals; 1972–1979), Brent Mydland (keyboards, vocals; 1979–1990), and Vince Welnick (keyboards, vocals; 1990–1995). Bruce Hornsby (accordion, piano, vocals) was a touring member from 1990 to 1992, as well as a guest with the band on occasion before and after the tours.
</p><p>After the death of Garcia in 1995, former members of the band, along with other musicians, toured as the Other Ones in 1998, 2000, and 2002, and the Dead in 2003, 2004, and 2009. In 2015, the four surviving core members marked the band's 50th anniversary in a series of concerts that were billed as their last performances together. There have also been several spin-offs featuring one or more core members, such as Dead &amp; Company, Furthur, the Rhythm Devils, Phil Lesh and Friends, RatDog, and Billy &amp; the Kids.

<p><b>Franz Peter Schubert</b> (<small>German: </small><span title=""Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)"" lang=""de-Latn-fonipa"">[ˈfʁant͡s ˈpeːtɐ ˈʃuːbɐt]</span>; 31 January 1797 – 19 November 1828) was an Austrian composer of the late Classical and early Romantic eras. Despite his short lifetime, Schubert left behind a vast <i>oeuvre</i>, including more than 600 secular vocal works (mainly lieder), seven complete symphonies, sacred music, operas, incidental music, and a large body of piano and chamber music. His major works include ""Erlkönig"" (D. 328), the Piano Quintet in A major, D. 667 (<i>Trout Quintet</i>), the Symphony No. 8 in B minor, D. 759 (<i>Unfinished Symphony</i>), the ""Great"" Symphony No. 9 in C major, D. 944, the String Quintet (D. 956), the three last piano sonatas (D. 958–960), the opera <i>Fierrabras</i> (D. 796), the incidental music to the play <i>Rosamunde</i> (D. 797), and the song cycles <i>Die schöne Müllerin</i> (D. 795) and <i>Winterreise</i> (D. 911).
</p><p>Born in the Himmelpfortgrund suburb of Vienna, Schubert showed uncommon gifts for music from an early age. His father gave him his first violin lessons and his elder brother gave him piano lessons, but Schubert soon exceeded their abilities. In 1808, at the age of eleven, he became a pupil at the Stadtkonvikt school, where he became acquainted with the orchestral music of Joseph Haydn, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and Ludwig van Beethoven. He left the Stadtkonvikt at the end of 1813, and returned home to live with his father, where he began studying to become a schoolteacher. Despite this, he continued his studies in composition with Antonio Salieri and still composed prolifically. In 1821, Schubert was admitted to the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde as a performing member, which helped establish his name among the Viennese citizenry. He gave a concert of his own works to critical acclaim in March 1828, the only time he did so in his career. He died eight months later at the age of 31, the cause officially attributed to typhoid fever, but believed by some historians to be syphilis.
</p><p>Appreciation of Schubert's music while he was alive was limited to a relatively small circle of admirers in Vienna, but interest in his work increased greatly in the decades following his death. Felix Mendelssohn, Robert Schumann, Franz Liszt, Johannes Brahms and other 19th-century composers discovered and championed his works. Today, Schubert is ranked among the greatest composers in the history of Western music and his work continues to be admired and performed.

<p><b>Styx</b> (<span></span>) is an American rock band formed in Chicago, Illinois, in 1972 and is known for incorporating hard rock guitar balanced with acoustic guitar, synthesizers mixed with acoustic piano, upbeat tracks with power ballads, and incorporating elements of international musical theatre. The band established itself with a progressive rock sound in the 1970s, and began to incorporate pop and soft rock elements in the 1980s.
</p><p>Debuting with <i>Styx</i> in 1972, the band usually released an album every year throughout the 1970s. <i>Styx II</i> (1973) had the sleeper hit ""Lady"", a power ballad, which reached No. 6 in the US, helping the album make the top 20.

</p><p>Styx's commercial breakthrough in North America came with <i>The Grand Illusion</i> (1977), which peaked at No. 6 in both the US and Canada, and became the first of four straight multi-platinum albums in the US for Styx. It featured the single ""Come Sail Away"", a top 10 hit in both countries. The band's follow-up, <i>Pieces of Eight</i> (1978), was another No. 6 hit in the US, but peaked higher in Canada due to the top 10 hits ""Renegade"" and ""Blue Collar Man (Long Nights)"". In 1979, Styx's <i>Cornerstone</i> went to No. 2 in both countries on the strength of the cross-border No. 1 hit ballad ""Babe"". The album became their breakthrough album in Australia and New Zealand, reaching the top 20, with ""Babe"" peaking at No. 3. ""Babe"" was a No. 6 hit in the UK, their first and only top 40 hit there, leading <i>Cornerstone</i> to be their first album to chart there (at No. 36).</p><p>In 1981, Styx's <i>Paradise Theatre</i> was a No. 1 album in the US and Canada, while also reaching the top 10 in Scandinavia and the UK (their biggest album there) and the top 30 in Australia and New Zealand. ""The Best of Times"" from the album reached No. 1 in Canada, No. 3 in the US, and the top 30 in several other countries, while ""Too Much Time on My Hands"" was also a top 10 hit in North America. <i>Kilroy Was Here</i> (1983) was Styx's last major hit album, reaching the top 3 in North America and the top 10 in Scandinavia, although it was less successful elsewhere. Its lead single, ""Mr. Roboto"", became Styx's third chart-topper in Canada, was a No. 3 hit in the US, and was their biggest hit in Germany (No. 8). After a seven-year break, Styx returned with <i>Edge of the Century</i> (1990), which reached No. 63 in the US with its single, ""Show Me the Way"", becoming a top 3 hit in North America in early 1991.</p><p>Overall, Styx had eight songs that hit the top 10 on the US <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100, as well as 16 top 40 singles.

</p>
<p>The <b>Misfits</b> are an American punk rock band often recognized as the pioneers of the horror punk subgenre, blending punk and other musical influences with horror film themes and imagery. The group was founded in 1977 in Lodi, New Jersey, by vocalist, songwriter and keyboardist Glenn Danzig, Danzig's first recruit to the Misfits was drummer Mr. Jim and bassist Diane DiPazza, however, DiPiazza never showed up. Mr. Jim was replaced by Manny Martinez shortly after. Jerry Only joined on bass guitar shortly after. Over the next six years, membership would change frequently with Danzig and Only remaining the two sole consistent members. During this time period, they released several EPs and singles, and with Only's brother Doyle as guitarist, the albums <i>Walk Among Us</i> (1982) and <i>Earth A.D./Wolfs Blood</i> (1983), both considered to have significance to the early-1980s hardcore punk movement. The band has gone through many lineup changes over the years, with bassist Jerry Only being the only constant member in the group.
</p><p>The Misfits disbanded in 1983, and Glenn Danzig went on to form Samhain and then Danzig. Several albums of reissued and previously unreleased material were issued after the group's dissolution, and their music later became influential to punk rock, heavy metal, hard rock, and alternative rock, including high-profile acts such as Metallica, Guns N' Roses, Marilyn Manson, Green Day, the Offspring, NOFX, AFI and My Chemical Romance. After a series of legal battles with Danzig, Only and Doyle regained the rights to record and perform as the Misfits. They formed a new version of the band in 1995 with singer Michale Graves and drummer Dr. Chud. This incarnation of Misfits had more of a heavy metal sound, and released the albums <i>American Psycho</i> (1997) and <i>Famous Monsters</i> (1999) before dissolving in 2000. Jerry Only then took over lead vocals and recruited former Black Flag guitarist Dez Cadena and former Ramones drummer Marky Ramone for a Misfits 25th anniversary tour.
</p><p>This lineup released an album of cover songs titled <i>Project 1950</i> and toured for several years. In 2005, Marky was replaced by Robo, who had played with Black Flag in the early 1980s and had also previously been Misfits' drummer from 1982 to 1983. This lineup released a single titled ""Land of the Dead"" in 2009. The Misfits' lineup of Only, Cadena, and drummer Eric ""Chupacabra"" Arce released a new album titled <i>The Devil's Rain</i> in October 2011. In 2015, it was announced that Cadena would be taking a break from music after receiving a cancer diagnosis, and was replaced by Only's son Jerry Caiafa II, presented as Jerry Other. That same year Soulfly's Marc Rizzo joined the band, also playing guitar. He filled in for Cadena, before Caiafa would become the sole guitarist for the band.
</p><p>In September 2016, for the first time in 33 years, Danzig, Only, and Doyle reunited for two headlining shows as the Original Misfits at that year's edition of Riot Fest, along with drummer Dave Lombardo and second guitarist Acey Slade. The Original Misfits lineup continued performing sporadically through the present.

</p>
<p><b>Machine Head</b> is an American heavy metal band from Oakland, California. The band was formed in 1991 by vocalist/rhythm guitarist Robb Flynn, who remains the only original member of the band. Machine Head's aggressive musicianship made it one of the pioneering bands in the new wave of American heavy metal. Its current lineup comprises Flynn, bassist Jared MacEachern, lead guitarist Wacław Kiełtyka and drummer Matt Alston. Bassist Adam Duce, lead guitarists Logan Mader, Ahrue Luster and Phil Demmel, and drummers Tony Costanza, Chris Kontos and Dave McClain are former members of the band; Mader and Kontos toured with the band in 2019 and 2020 as part of the 25th anniversary tour for its first album, <i>Burn My Eyes</i> (1994).
</p><p>Machine Head's first four albums earned the band a growing fan base in Europe, however the band would not have success in the United States until later releases. The band drew controversy with its fourth album, <i>Supercharger</i> (2001), which was released three weeks after the September 11 attacks; its only single, ""Crashing Around You"", and its music video (which featured burning buildings) was pulled from all media outlets. The band nearly disbanded in 2002 after negotiating off its label Roadrunner Records as a result of the controversy, however the band would eventually re-sign with the label.
</p><p>Having experimented with elements of groove metal and nu metal in its early releases, Machine Head changed to a more traditional thrash metal sound and longer songs with its sixth album, <i>The Blackening</i> (2007), which drew critical acclaim and was chosen as Album of the Decade by <i>Metal Hammer</i> in 2010; the album's first single, ""Aesthetics of Hate"", also earned the band a Grammy Award nomination. The band achieved similar success with its following two albums, <i>Unto the Locust</i> (2011) and <i>Bloodstone &amp; Diamonds</i> (2014), before once again experimenting with nu metal on the band's ninth album, <i>Catharsis</i> (2018).

<p><b>Public Enemy</b> is an American hip hop group formed by Chuck D and Flavor Flav on Long Island, New York, in 1985. The group rose to prominence for their political messages including subjects such as American racism and the American media. Their debut album, <i>Yo! Bum Rush the Show</i>, was released in 1987 to critical acclaim, and their second album, <i>It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back</i> (1988), was the first hip hop album to top <i>The Village Voice</i><span>'</span>s Pazz &amp; Jop critics' poll. Their next three albums, <i>Fear of a Black Planet</i> (1990), <i>Apocalypse 91... The Enemy Strikes Black</i> (1991) and <i>Muse Sick-n-Hour Mess Age</i> (1994), were also well received. The group has since released twelve more studio albums, including the soundtrack to the 1998 sports-drama film <i>He Got Game</i> and a collaborative album with Paris, <i>Rebirth of a Nation</i> (2006).
</p><p>Public Enemy has gone through many lineup changes over the years, with Chuck D and Flavor Flav remaining the only constant members. Co-founder Professor Griff left in 1989 but rejoined in 1998, before parting ways again some years later. DJ Lord also joined Public Enemy in 1998 as the replacement of the group's original DJ Terminator X. In 2020, it was announced that Flavor Flav had been fired from the group. His firing was later revealed to be a publicity stunt that was called an April Fools' Day prank. Public Enemy, without Flavor Flav, would also tour and record music under the name of Public Enemy Radio which consists of the lineup of Chuck D, Jahi, DJ Lord and the S1Ws.
</p><p>Public Enemy's first four albums during the late 1980s and early 1990s were all certified either gold or platinum and were, according to music critic Robert Hilburn in 1998, ""the most acclaimed body of work ever by a hip hop act"". Critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine called them ""the most influential and radical band of their time"". They were inducted into Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2013. They were honored with the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at the 62nd Grammy Awards.

<p><b>The Darkness</b> are a British rock band that formed in Lowestoft, England in 2000. The band consists of Justin Hawkins (lead vocals, lead guitar), his brother Dan Hawkins (rhythm guitar, backing vocals), Frankie Poullain (bass guitar, backing vocals) and Rufus Tiger Taylor (drums, backing vocals).
</p><p>The Darkness came to prominence with the release of their debut album, <i>Permission to Land</i>, in 2003. Backed by the singles ""I Believe in a Thing Called Love"", ""Growing on Me"", ""Get Your Hands off My Woman"", and ""Love Is Only a Feeling"", the album was certified quadruple platinum in the United Kingdom, with sales of over 1.3 million. In 2004 the band won three Brit Awards: Best British Group, Best British Rock Act, and Best British Album.</p><p>After extensive touring in support of their debut album, Poullain left the band in 2005, and was replaced by former guitar technician Richie Edwards. The band's second studio album, <i>One Way Ticket to Hell... and Back</i>, was released in November 2005. The following year, Justin Hawkins departed from the band after successfully completing a course of rehabilitation from alcohol and cocaine abuse. This, combined with the poor sales of the album, resulted in Atlantic dropping the band in October 2006. After the split, the remaining members formed Stone Gods, and continued to perform and record without Hawkins, who subsequently fronted his own project, Hot Leg.
</p><p>On 15 March 2011, the Darkness announced reunion shows, with original bassist Frankie Poullain, including Download Festival 2011, and the Isle of Wight Festival 2012. Their third album, <i>Hot Cakes</i>, was released on 20 August 2012. Original drummer Ed Graham then left the band, feeling the strain of touring was affecting his personal life, in which he had pressing issues. In 2015 a fourth studio album was announced, entitled <i>Last of Our Kind</i>, which was released on 2 June 2015. A fifth album, <i>Pinewood Smile</i>, was released on 6 October 2017 and one year later on 15 June 2018 a live album, <i>Live at Hammersmith</i>, was also released. Their sixth studio album, <i>Easter Is Cancelled</i> was released on 4 October 2019.
</p><p>After the COVID-19 pandemic put a stop to their world tour in 2020, the band wound up the year with a one-off streamed live show titled ""Streaming of a White Christmas"", which was also recorded as a new live album and slated to be released on CD and vinyl in June 2021.
</p><p>On 4 June 2021, the band announced their seventh studio album <i>Motorheart</i> would be released on 15 October 2021 with an extensive UK tour through November and December 2021.

</p>
<p><b>The Monkees</b> were an American pop rock band, formed in Los Angeles in 1966, whose lineup consisted of the American actors/musicians Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith and Peter Tork alongside English actor/singer Davy Jones. The group was conceived in 1965 by television producers Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider for the situation comedy series of the same name. Music credited to the band was released on LP, as well as being included in the show, which aired from 1966 to 1968.
</p><p>While the sitcom was a mostly straightforward affair, the music production generated tension and controversy almost from the beginning. Music supervisor Don Kirshner was dissatisfied with the quartet's musical abilities, and he limited their involvement during the recording process, relying instead on professional songwriters and studio musicians. This arrangement yielded multiple hit albums and singles, but it did not sit well with the band members, who were facing a public backlash for not playing on the recordings. After a brief power struggle, the band members gained full control over the recording process. For two albums, the Monkees mostly performed as a group, but, within a year, each member was pursuing his own interests under the Monkees name. By the end of 1968, they were once again a group in name only, the show had been canceled, and their motion picture, <i>Head</i>, had flopped. Tork left the band soon after, followed by Nesmith a year later, and the Monkees officially broke up in 1970.
</p><p>A revival of interest in the television show came in 1986, leading to a series of official reunion tours, a television special, and four new full-length records, all of which spanned the next 35 years, though these efforts rarely featured all four members performing together. With Jones' death in 2012 and Tork's in 2019, Dolenz and Nesmith were left to embark on a farewell tour in 2021, finishing shortly before Nesmith's death at the end of the year.
</p><p>Spurred by the success of the show, the Monkees were one of the most successful bands of the 1960s. The band sold more than 75 million records worldwide making them one of the biggest-selling groups of all time with international hits, including ""Last Train to Clarksville"", ""I'm a Believer"", ""A Little Bit Me, a Little Bit You"", ""Pleasant Valley Sunday"", and ""Daydream Believer"", four chart-topping albums and three chart-topping songs (""Last Train to Clarksville"", ""I'm a Believer"", and ""Daydream Believer""). Newspapers and magazines falsely reported that the Monkees outsold the Beatles and the Rolling Stones combined in 1967, a claim that originated from Nesmith in a 1977 interview.</p>",Los Angeles

</p>
<p><b>Ashlee Ross-Naess</b>(<span title=""Name at birth"">née </span> <b>Simpson</b>) (born October 3, 1984) known professionally as <b>Ashlee Simpson</b>, is an American singer and actress. The younger sister of singer and actress Jessica Simpson, she began her career as a back-up dancer for her sister and appeared in television commercials at the age of 15. She later pursued a career as an actress and had a main role on the family drama <i>7th Heaven.</i> She appeared on the reality show <i>Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica</i>, broadcast on MTV between 2003 and 2005, which focused on Ashlee's older sister Jessica and Jessica's then-husband Nick Lachey. While working on her debut studio album, Simpson became the star of a spin-off reality series, <i>The Ashlee Simpson Show</i>, which was broadcast on MTV between 2004 and 2005. Like her sister before her, Simpson became the center of considerable media attention.
</p><p>Her breakout came with her debut single, ""Pieces of Me"", which was released in 2004, became a top-five hit in the United States and topped the <i>Billboard</i> Mainstream Top 40 chart based on radio airplay. The success of the single and her reality show helped propel her debut album, <i>Autobiography,</i> also released in 2004, to the top of the <i>Billboard</i> 200 albums chart. The project sold over five million copies worldwide, making it her most successful album to date. Simpson had a leading role in the film <i>Undiscovered</i> (2005), which became a critical and commercial flop. The failure of the film, along with multiple critically panned performances, led to media scrutiny. Despite that, Simpson's second studio album, <i>I Am Me</i> (2005), debuted atop the <i>Billboard</i> 200, becoming her second album to do so. The album went on to receive a platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).
</p><p>Following her appearance as Roxie Hart in the West End production of <i>Chicago,</i> Simpson announced that she had begun working on her third studio album. The album differed from the pop-rock sound of her previous efforts, featuring a dance-pop and 1980s-themed sound. <i>Bittersweet World</i> was released in 2008 to positive critical reception, but it saw a decline in sales. The effort reached number 4 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200. The following year, Simpson joined the main cast of the <i>Melrose Place</i> revamp, which was met with harsh critical reception. Later that year, she made her Broadway debut reprising her role as Roxie Hart in <i>Chicago</i> on Broadway.
</p><p>Simpson announced a fourth studio album that same year. She independently released the single ""Bat for a Heart"" (2012), though it failed to have success. Simpson eventually scrapped the album and focused on her child. Simpson reprised her role as Roxie Hart for the third time in a 2-dates special production in Hollywood Bowl in July 2013 directed by Brooke Shields. In October, Simpson and her husband Evan Ross released their debut extended play (EP) by Ashlee + Evan through Access Records, which was supported by a tour in select cities across North America, and their TV-reality show.</p>

<p><b>Joanna Noëlle Levesque</b> (born December 20, 1990), known professionally as <b>JoJo</b>, is an American singer and actress. She began performing in singing competitions and local talent shows as a child. In 2003, record producer Vincent Herbert noticed her after she competed on the television show <i>America's Most Talented Kids</i> and asked her to audition for his record label Blackground Records. After signing with the label, JoJo released her eponymous debut studio album in 2004.

<p><b>UB40</b> are an English reggae and pop band, formed in December 1978 in Birmingham, England. The band has had more than 50 singles in the UK Singles Chart, and has also achieved considerable international success. They have been nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Reggae Album four times, and in 1984 were nominated for the Brit Award for Best British Group. UB40 have sold over 70 million records worldwide. The ethnic make-up of the band's original line-up was diverse, with musicians of English, Welsh, Irish, Jamaican, Scottish, and Yemeni parentage.</p><p>Their hit singles include their debut ""Food for Thought"" and two <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 number ones with ""Red Red Wine"" and ""Can't Help Falling in Love"". Both of these also topped the UK Singles Chart, as did the band's version of ""I Got You Babe"", recorded with Chrissie Hynde. Their two most successful albums, <i>Labour of Love</i> (1983) and <i>Promises and Lies</i> (1993), reached number one on the UK Albums Chart. UB40 and the English ska band Madness hold the record for most weeks spent by a group in the UK singles chart during the 1980s, with 214 weeks each.</p><p>The band's line-up was stable for nearly 29 years, from March 1979 until January 2008, when frontman Ali Campbell left the band, followed shortly thereafter by keyboardist Mickey Virtue. Another member, Astro, remained with the band until November 2013, when he departed the original band to team up with Campbell and Virtue in a new version of UB40. In 2014, legal advice was sought by the original band (now consisting of remaining co-founding members drummer Jimmy Brown, guitarist Robin Campbell, bassist Earl Falconer, percussionist Norman Hassan, and saxophonist Brian Travers, along with new vocalist Duncan Campbell) who took action against the group containing Campbell, Virtue, and Astro over usage of the band name, due to it being used by both parties. On 5 July 2021, it was announced that Matt Doyle (formerly of the reggae band Kioko) would become the band's new vocalist, following Duncan Campbell's retirement due to ill health.

<p><b>Men at Work</b> is an Australian rock band formed in Melbourne in 1978 and best known for breakthrough hits such as ""Down Under"", ""Who Can It Be Now?"", ""Be Good Johnny"", ""Overkill"", and ""It's a Mistake"". Its founding member and frontman is Colin Hay, who performs on lead vocals and guitar. After playing as an acoustic duo with Ron Strykert during 1978–1979, Hay formed the group with Strykert playing bass guitar and Jerry Speiser on drums. They were soon joined by Greg Ham on flute, saxophone, and keyboards and John Rees on bass guitar, with Strykert switching back to lead guitar. The group was managed by Russell Depeller, a friend of Hay, whom he met at La Trobe University. This line-up achieved national and international success during the early to mid-1980s. 
</p><p>In January 1983, they were the first Australian artists to have a simultaneous No. 1 album and No. 1 single on the United States <i>Billboard</i> charts: <i>Business as Usual</i> (released on 9 November 1981) and ""Down Under"" (1981), respectively. With the same works, they achieved the distinction of a simultaneous No. 1 album and No. 1 single on the Australian, New Zealand, and United Kingdom charts. Their second album <i>Cargo</i> (2 May 1983) was also No. 1 in Australia, No. 2 in New Zealand, No. 3 in the US, and No. 8 in the UK. Their third album <i>Two Hearts</i> (3 April 1985) reached the top 20 in Australia and top 50 in the US.
</p><p>They won the Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 1983, they were inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame in 1994, and they have sold over 30 million albums worldwide. In May 2001, ""Down Under"" was listed at No. 4 on the APRA Top 30 Australian songs and <i>Business as Usual</i> appeared in the book <i>100 Best Australian Albums</i> (October 2010).
</p><p>In 1984, Speiser and Rees were asked to leave the group, leaving Hay, Ham, and Strykert. During the recording of the <i>Two Hearts</i> album, Strykert decided to leave. Soon after the release of <i>Two Hearts</i>, Ham left also, leaving Hay as the sole remaining member. From 1996 until 2002 Hay and Ham toured the world as Men at Work. On 19 April 2012, Ham was found dead at his home from an apparent heart attack.</p><p>In 2019, Hay revived the Men at Work moniker and began touring with the assistance of a backing band including none of the other original members.

He has lived in Scotland, Hertfordshire (England), London, California, and—since at least 2008—in County Cork, Ireland, with his family. Emerging from the British folk scene, Donovan reached fame in the United Kingdom in early 1965 with live performances on the pop TV series <i>Ready Steady Go!</i>.
</p><p>Having signed with Pye Records in 1965, he recorded singles and two albums in the folk vein for Hickory Records, after which he signed to CBS/Epic in the US—the first signing by the company's new vice-president Clive Davis—and became more successful internationally. He began a long and successful collaboration with leading British independent record producer Mickie Most, scoring multiple hit singles and albums in the UK, US, and other countries.</p><p>He emerged onto the scene in 1965 with three UK hit singles: ""Catch the Wind"", ""Colours"" and ""Universal Soldier"", the last written by Buffy Sainte-Marie. In September 1966, ""Sunshine Superman"" topped America's <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 chart for one week and went to No. 2 in Britain, followed by ""Mellow Yellow"" at US No. 2 in December 1966, then 1968's ""Hurdy Gurdy Man"" in the top 5 in both countries, and then ""Atlantis"", which reached US No. 7 in May 1969. The compilation <i>Donovan's Greatest Hits</i> was released in March 1969 and peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard 200.</p><p>He became a friend of pop and folk musicians including Joan Baez, Brian Jones, and the Beatles. He taught John Lennon a finger-picking guitar style in 1968 that Lennon employed in ""Dear Prudence"", ""Julia"", ""Happiness Is a Warm Gun"", and other songs. His backing musicians included the Jeff Beck Group, and John Bonham, Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones, who later rose to fame as members of Led Zeppelin. Donovan's commercial fortunes waned after parting with Most in 1969, and he left the industry for a time.
</p><p>Donovan continued to perform and record sporadically in the 1970s and 1980s.  His musical style and hippie image were scorned by critics, especially after the rise of punk rock. His performing and recording became sporadic until a revival in the 1990s with the emergence of Britain's rave scene. He recorded the 1996 album <i>Sutras</i> with producer Rick Rubin and in 2004 made a new album, <i>Beat Cafe</i>. Donovan was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012 and the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2014.

<p><b>Curtis Lee Mayfield</b> (June 3, 1942 – December 26, 1999) was an American singer-songwriter, guitarist, and record producer, and one of the most influential musicians behind soul and politically conscious African-American music. Dubbed the ""Gentle Genius,"" he first achieved success and recognition with the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame-inducted group The Impressions during the civil rights movement of the late 1950s and the 1960s, and later worked as a solo artist.
</p><p>Mayfield started his musical career in a gospel choir. Moving to the North Side of Chicago, he met Jerry Butler in 1956 at the age of 14, and joined the vocal group The Impressions.  As a songwriter, Mayfield became noted as one of the first musicians to bring more prevalent themes of social awareness into soul music.  In 1965, he wrote ""People Get Ready"" for the Impressions, which was ranked at no. 24 on <i>Rolling Stone</i>'s list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. The song received numerous other awards, and was included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll, as well as being inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1998.
</p><p>After leaving the Impressions in 1970 in the pursuit of a solo career, Mayfield released several albums, including the soundtrack for the blaxploitation film <i>Super Fly</i> in 1972. The soundtrack was noted for its socially conscious themes, mostly addressing problems surrounding inner city minorities such as crime, poverty and drug abuse. The album was ranked at no. 72 on <i>Rolling Stone'</i>s list of 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.</p><p>Mayfield was paralyzed from the neck down after lighting equipment fell on him during a live performance at Wingate Field in Flatbush, Brooklyn, New York, on August 13, 1990. Despite this, he continued his career as a recording artist, releasing his final album <i>New World Order</i> in 1996. Mayfield won a Grammy Legend Award in 1994 and a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1995. He is a double inductee into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, as a member of the Impressions in 1991, and again in 1999 as a solo artist. He was also a two-time Grammy Hall of Fame inductee. He died from complications of type 2 diabetes at the age of 57 on December 26, 1999.</p>

</p>
<p><b>Everything but the Girl</b> is an English musical duo formed in Kingston upon Hull in 1982, consisting of lead singer and occasional guitarist Tracey Thorn and guitarist, keyboardist, producer and singer Ben Watt. The group's early works have been categorized as sophisti-pop with jazz influences before undergoing an electronic turn following the worldwide success of the 1994 hit single ""Missing"".</p><p>The duo have accomplished four top ten and twelve top 40 singles in the UK and have received eight gold and two platinum album BPI certifications in the UK as well as one gold album RIAA certification in the US. Their cover of ""I Don't Want to Talk About It"" reached number three on the UK Singles Chart in 1988, a feat which would later be matched by ""Missing"", which charted high in several countries and reached number two on the U.S. <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 in 1995 and spent over seven months on the UK Singles Chart thanks to an extremely popular remix by Todd Terry which later led to a Brit Award nomination for Best British Single.
</p><p>Their ninth album <i>Walking Wounded</i> (1996) set a new career best by entering the UK albums chart at number four; it spawned the top ten singles ""Walking Wounded"" and ""Wrong"". The band went inactive in 2000, with Thorn declaring that she would no longer perform live. Thorn and Watt, who did not publicise their romantic relationship with each other while active, married in 2009, both released solo albums and said it was unlikely that Everything But the Girl would be active again.</p><p>However, in November 2022, Thorn announced that a new album had been recorded for release in spring 2023. <i>Fuse,</i> the band's first new material in 24 years, will be released on 21 April 2023.

They have written for and starred in the American TV program <i>Saturday Night Live</i> (<i>SNL</i>).
</p><p>The three first met in junior high. After graduating from college, they regrouped and moved to Los Angeles, where they struggled to find work and began making short films, combining absurdist comedy and occasionally music. Among the first performers to post their material on the Internet, they involved themselves with Channel 101, a non-profit monthly short film festival. Their popularity at the screenings led to unsuccessful pilot deals with Fox and Comedy Central and a writing job for the 2005 MTV Movie Awards. Subsequently, that show's host, Jimmy Fallon, recommended them to Lorne Michaels, the creator of <i>Saturday Night Live</i>.
</p><p>The group was hired for <i>SNL</i> in 2005, with all three as writers and Samberg as a featured player. Bypassing the traditional process of pitching, they recorded their own material independently and submitted it to the program. Their second sketch to air, ""Lazy Sunday"", became an internet sensation, the first of many viral videos they produced while at <i>SNL</i>. They led their own division at the program — <i>SNL</i> Digital Shorts — which led to numerous viral videos, including ""Motherlover"", ""Dick in a Box"", ""Jizz in My Pants"", ""I'm on a Boat"", ""Like a Boss"", ""I Just Had Sex"", ""Jack Sparrow"", and ""YOLO"". Their musical comedic work has comprised four full studio albums: <i>Incredibad</i> (2009), <i>Turtleneck &amp; Chain</i> (2011), <i>The Wack Album</i> (2013), and <i>The Unauthorized Bash Brothers Experience</i> (2019), along with a soundtrack album for their 2016 film <i>Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping</i>. The three retired from <i>SNL</i> in the early 2010s, but occasionally make guest appearances.

The band currently consists of Bradford Cox (vocals, guitar, keyboards), Moses Archuleta (drums, electronics, sound treatments), Lockett Pundt (guitar, vocals, keyboards), Josh McKay (bass) and Javier Morales (keyboards, synthesizers, alto saxophone).
</p><p>Founded by Cox and Archuleta, Deerhunter's first stable line-up included guitarist Colin Mee and bass guitarist Justin Bosworth. After recording a split EP with Alphabets, Bosworth died on March 29, 2004, of head injuries suffered during a skateboarding accident. He was 23 years old. The band recorded their first studio album, <i>Turn It Up Faggot</i> (2005), with Josh Fauver occupying the vacant role of bass guitarist. Following the album's release, Cox asked childhood friend, Lockett Pundt, to join Deerhunter as a song-writing partner, second guitarist, and occasional lead vocalist.
</p><p>Recorded in two days, the band's follow-up, <i>Cryptograms</i> (2007), combined ambient work and more angular garage rock songs. The release was quickly followed by the EP, <i>Fluorescent Grey</i>. While touring the releases, Mee departed from Deerhunter, due to disagreements over the band's schedule, but rejoined soon after. Deerhunter released two studio albums, <i>Microcastle</i> and <i>Weird Era Cont.</i>, in 2008. Both albums were recorded without the participation of Mee, who again departed for a second and final time. The band enlisted former cheerleader and high school friend of Cox, Whitney Petty, as his touring replacement.
</p><p>Recorded as a four-piece with producer Ben H. Allen and engineer David Barbe the band's fourth studio album, <i>Halcyon Digest</i> (2010), was released to widespread critical acclaim, ranked as Pitchfork's 29th and Stereogum's 78th best album of the decade. In 2012, the departure of long-time bassist Fauver placed the band's future in doubt. Cox, Pundt and Archuleta regrouped with new members, bassist Josh McKay and guitarist Frankie Broyles, to record the primitivist garage rock and musique concrète-influenced <i>Monomania</i> (2013). The album expanded on a darker and more disturbing sound, complete with treated tape recordings of rats and insects, exploring themes of disassociation and mental illness.
</p><p>The following year, Cox was struck by a vehicle while walking his dog near his home in Atlanta's Grant Park. During his recovery and rehabilitation he focused on writing songs resulting in the album <i>Fading Frontier</i> (2015).
</p><p>Deerhunter have described themselves as ""ambient punk,"" though they incorporate a wide range of genres, including noise, garage rock, art rock, as well as significant pop elements.

<p><b>Johannes Brahms</b> (<small>German: </small><span title=""Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)"" lang=""de-Latn-fonipa"">[joˈhanəs ˈbʁaːms]</span>; 7 May 1833 – 3 April 1897) was a German composer, pianist, and conductor of the mid-Romantic period. Born in Hamburg into a Lutheran family, he spent much of his professional life in Vienna. He is sometimes grouped with Johann Sebastian Bach and Ludwig van Beethoven as one of the ""Three Bs"" of music, a comment originally made by the nineteenth-century conductor Hans von Bülow.
</p><p>Brahms composed for symphony orchestra, chamber ensembles, piano, organ, violin, voice, and chorus. A virtuoso pianist, he premiered many of his own works. He worked with leading performers of his time, including the pianist Clara Schumann and the violinist Joseph Joachim (the three were close friends). Many of his works have become staples of the modern concert repertoire.
</p><p>Brahms has been considered both a traditionalist and an innovator, by his contemporaries and by later writers. His music is rooted in the structures and compositional techniques of the Classical masters. Embedded within those structures are deeply romantic motifs. While some contemporaries found his music to be overly academic, his contribution and craftsmanship were admired by subsequent figures as diverse as Arnold Schoenberg and Edward Elgar. The detailed construction of Brahms's works was a starting point and an inspiration for a generation of composers.

<p><b>Roxy Music</b> are an English rock band formed in 1970 by Bryan Ferry—who became the band's lead vocalist and principal songwriter—and bassist Graham Simpson. The other longtime members are Phil Manzanera (guitar), Andy Mackay (saxophone and oboe), and Paul Thompson (drums and percussion). Other members included Brian Eno (synthesizer and ""treatments"") and Eddie Jobson (synthesizer and violin). Although the band took a break from group activities in 1976 and again in 1983, they reunited for a concert tour in 2001, and have toured together intermittently since. Ferry frequently enlisted band members as session musicians for his solo releases.
</p><p>Roxy Music became a successful act in Europe and Australia during the 1970s. This success began with their self-titled debut studio album in 1972. The band pioneered more musically sophisticated elements of glam rock while significantly influencing early English punk music, and provided a model for many new wave acts while innovating elements of electronic composition. The group also conveyed their distinctive brand of visual and musical sophistication with their focus on glamorous fashions. Ferry and co-founding member Eno have had influential solo careers. Eno became one of the most significant British record producers of the late 20th century. <i>Rolling Stone</i> originally ranked Roxy Music No. 98 on their greatest artists list  (""The Immortals – The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time""), but dropped the group from the list when they updated it in 2011.</p><p>Roxy Music's final studio album was <i>Avalon</i> (1982), which was certified Platinum in the United States. In 2005, the band began recording what would have become their ninth studio album—and their first album with Eno since 1973 (he wrote two songs for it and also played keyboards). However, Ferry eventually announced that the material from these sessions would instead be released as a Ferry solo studio album, with Eno playing on ""a couple of tracks"", and that he believed the group would never again produce a record as Roxy Music. The album was released in 2010 as the Ferry solo studio album <i>Olympia</i>. It featured contributions from Eno, Manzanera, and Mackay (amongst many other session players).
</p><p>In 2011, Roxy Music played a series of 40th-anniversary shows, but went inactive as a performing entity following the concerts. In 2019, Roxy Music were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.</p><p>In 2022 Roxy Music returned for a tour to mark the 50th anniversary of their debut studio album.</p>",County Durham

<p><b>Thrice</b> is an American rock band from Irvine, California, formed in 1998. The group was founded by guitarist/vocalist Dustin Kensrue and lead guitarist Teppei Teranishi while they were in high school.
</p><p>Early in their career, the band was known for melodic hardcore punk music based in heavily distorted guitars, prominent lead guitar lines, and frequent changes in complex time signatures. This style is exemplified on their second album, <i>The Illusion of Safety</i> (2002) and their third album <i>The Artist in the Ambulance</i> (2003). Their fourth album <i>Vheissu</i> (2005) made significant changes by incorporating electronic beats, keyboards, and a more experimental sound. In 2007 and 2008, Thrice released <i>The Alchemy Index</i>, consisting of two studio albums that together make a four-part, 24-song cycle. Each of the four six-song EPs of the Alchemy Index features significantly different styles, based on different aspects of the band's musical esthetic which reflect the elemental themes of fire, water, air and earth, both lyrically and musically. The band's seventh album, <i>Beggars,</i> was released on August 11, 2009, and their eighth, <i>Major/Minor</i> on September 20, 2011. The most recent albums feature a refined combination of the band's different experiments and explorations. In 2011, Thrice announced a final tour and an imminent hiatus.
</p><p>Kensrue and Teranishi decided to reform the band in 2015 after attending a Brand New concert. In 2016, Thrice released their first post-reunion album, <i>To Be Everywhere Is to Be Nowhere.</i> 
The band's tenth album, <i>Palms</i>, was released in 2018. Their eleventh studio album <i>Horizons/East</i> was released in September 2021. Each album released by Thrice has had a portion of its sales proceeds donated to a new charitable organization.</p>",Irvine

</p>
<p><b>Alkaline Trio</b> is an American punk rock band from Chicago, Illinois. Since 2001, the band has consisted of Matt Skiba (vocals, guitar), Dan Andriano (vocals, bass) and Derek Grant (drums, vocals).
</p><p>Founded in late 1996 by Skiba, bassist Rob Doran, and drummer Glenn Porter, Alkaline Trio released its debut single, ""Sundials"", in 1997. Following its release, Doran departed from the band and was replaced by Andriano. The band subsequently recorded an EP, <i>For Your Lungs Only</i> (1998), and its debut studio album, <i>Goddamnit</i> (1998). Following the release of the band's second album, <i>Maybe I'll Catch Fire</i> (2000), Porter left the band and was replaced by Mike Felumlee for its subsequent album, <i>From Here to Infirmary</i> (2001).
</p><p>Backed by the singles ""Stupid Kid"" and ""Private Eye"", <i>From Here to Infirmary</i> significantly increased the band's exposure, and its follow-up, <i>Good Mourning</i> (2003), charted highly on the <i>Billboard</i> 200. <i>Good Mourning</i> marked the recording debut of current drummer Derek Grant. In 2005, the band released <i>Crimson</i> which expanded upon the band's punk rock influences, with prominent overdubs and additional instrumentation, and continued with this direction on <i>Agony &amp; Irony</i> (2008), which was released on Epic Records.
</p><p>In 2010, the band released <i>This Addiction</i> on its own label Heart &amp; Skull and Epitaph. Recorded in the band's home town of Chicago, with early producer Matt Allison, the album was a conscious effort by the band to return to their punk rock roots; it became the highest-charting album of their career, debuting on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 at No. 11. In 2011, the band celebrated its 15-year anniversary with the release of <i>Damnesia</i>, which featured new, acoustic-based recordings of songs from across the band's career. The band's eighth studio album, <i>My Shame Is True</i>, was released on April 2, 2013.

It won the Mercury Music Prize and helped foster 'Britpop' as a musical movement, though the band distanced themselves from the term. 
</p><p>The recording sessions for their second album, <i>Dog Man Star</i>, were fraught with difficulty and ended with guitarist and composer Bernard Butler departing after confrontations with the other members. Guitarist and composer Richard Oakes replaced him and joined the band right before the accompanying tour. Although a commercial disappointment at the time, the album was met with a generally enthusiastic reception on release and has over time been lauded as one of rock music's great albums. In 1994, Suede would become a component of the Britpop ""big four"", along with Oasis, Blur and Pulp.</p><p>In 1996, following the recruitment of keyboard player Neil Codling, Suede went on to greater commercial success with <i>Coming Up</i>. The album reached number one in the UK, producing five top ten singles and becoming Suede's biggest-selling album worldwide. Despite problems within the band, Suede's fourth album, <i>Head Music</i> (1999), was a British chart-topper. The album was promoted heavily with the band receiving considerable press coverage on its release, however the response from fans and critics was less enthusiastic than for previous records. Codling left the band in 2001, citing chronic fatigue syndrome, and was replaced by Alex Lee. The band's fifth album, <i>A New Morning</i> (2002), the first following the collapse of Nude Records, was a commercial and critical disappointment, and the band disbanded the following year. In 2004, Anderson briefly reunited with Butler to form The Tears, before embarking on a solo career two years later.
</p><p>After much speculation Suede reformed in 2010 for a series of concerts. Three years on from their reunion gigs, Suede released their sixth album, <i>Bloodsports</i>. It was well received by critics and returned the band to the top ten in the UK. Their seventh album, <i>Night Thoughts</i>, followed in 2016 and became an even bigger critical and commercial success than its predecessor. Their eighth studio album, <i>The Blue Hour</i>, was released in September 2018. It became the group's first top five record since <i>Head Music</i>. Their ninth and most recent studio album, <i>Autofiction</i>, was released in September 2022.

<p><b>Dinosaur Jr.</b> is an American rock band formed in Amherst, Massachusetts, in 1984, originally simply called <b>Dinosaur</b> until legal issues forced a change in name.
</p><p>The band was founded by J Mascis (guitar, vocals, primary songwriter), Lou Barlow (bass, vocals), and Murph (drums). After three albums on independent labels, the band earned a reputation as one of the formative influences on American alternative rock. Creative tension led to Mascis firing Barlow, who later formed Sebadoh and Folk Implosion. His replacement, Mike Johnson, came aboard for three major-label albums. Murph eventually quit, with Mascis taking over drum duties on the band's albums before the group disbanded in 1997. The original lineup reformed in 2005, releasing five albums thereafter.</p><p>Mascis's drawling vocals and distinct guitar sound, hearkening back to 1960s and 1970s classic rock and characterized by extensive use of feedback and distortion, were highly influential in the alternative rock movement of the 1990s.</p>

<p><b>Derek and the Dominos</b> was a short-lived English–American blues rock band formed in the spring of 1970 by guitarist and singer Eric Clapton, keyboardist and singer Bobby Whitlock, bassist Carl Radle and drummer Jim Gordon. All four members had previously played together in Delaney &amp; Bonnie and Friends, during and after Clapton's brief tenure with Blind Faith. Dave Mason supplied additional lead guitar on early studio sessions and played at their first live gig. Another participant at their first session as a band was George Harrison, the recording for whose album <i>All Things Must Pass</i> marked the formation of Derek and the Dominos.
</p><p>The band released only one studio album, <i>Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs</i>, produced by Tom Dowd, which also featured extensive contributions on lead and slide guitar from Duane Allman. A double album, <i>Layla</i> did not immediately enjoy strong sales or receive widespread radio airplay, but went on to earn critical acclaim. Although released in 1970 it was not until March 1972 that the album's single ""Layla"" (a tale of unrequited love inspired by Clapton's infatuation with his friend George Harrison's wife, Pattie Boyd) made the top ten in both the United States and the United Kingdom. The album is often considered to be the defining achievement of Clapton's career.</p>",London

</p>
<p><b>Stephen Ray Vaughan</b> (October 3, 1954 – August 27, 1990) was an American musician, best known as the guitarist and frontman of the blues rock trio Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble. Although his mainstream career spanned only seven years, he is regarded as one of the most influential musicians in the history of blues music, and one of the greatest guitarists of all time. He was the younger brother of guitarist Jimmie Vaughan.
</p><p>Born and raised in Dallas, Vaughan began playing guitar at age seven, initially inspired by his elder brother, Jimmie Vaughan. In 1972, he dropped out of high school and moved to Austin, where he began to gain a following after playing gigs on the local club circuit. Vaughan joined forces with Tommy Shannon on bass and Chris Layton on drums as Double Trouble in 1978 and established it as part of the Austin music scene; it soon became one of the most popular acts in Texas. He performed at the Montreux Jazz Festival in 1982, where David Bowie saw him play. Bowie contacted him for a studio gig that resulted in Vaughan playing blues guitar on the album <i>Let's Dance</i> (1983), before being discovered by John Hammond who interested major label Epic Records in signing Vaughan and his band to a record deal. Within months, they achieved mainstream success for the critically acclaimed debut album <i>Texas Flood</i>. With a series of successful network television appearances and extensive concert tours, Vaughan became the leading figure in the blues revival of the 1980s.
Playing his guitar behind his back or plucking the strings with his teeth as Jimi Hendrix did, he earned fame in Europe, which later resulted in breakthroughs for guitar players like Robert Cray, Jeff Healey, Robben Ford, and Walter Trout, amongst others.
</p><p>During the majority of his life, Vaughan struggled with alcoholism and drug addiction. He also struggled with the personal and professional pressures of fame and his marriage to Lenora ""Lenny"" Bailey. He successfully completed rehabilitation and began touring again with Double Trouble in November 1986. His fourth and final studio album <i>In Step</i> reached number 33 in the United States in 1989; it was one of Vaughan's most critically and commercially successful releases and included his only number-one hit, ""Crossfire"". He became one of the world's most highly demanded blues performers, and he headlined Madison Square Garden in 1989 and the Beale Street Music Festival in 1990.
</p><p>On August 27, 1990, Vaughan and four others were killed in a helicopter crash in East Troy, Wisconsin, after performing with Double Trouble at Alpine Valley Music Theatre. An investigation concluded that the cause of the accident was pilot error and Vaughan's family later filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Omniflight Helicopters which was settled out of court. Vaughan's music continued to achieve commercial success with several posthumous releases and has sold over 15 million albums in the United States alone. In 2003, David Fricke of <i>Rolling Stone</i> ranked him the seventh greatest guitarist of all time. Vaughan was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2015, along with Double Trouble bandmates Chris Layton, Tommy Shannon, and Reese Wynans.

</p>
<p><b>Dead Kennedys</b> are an American punk rock band that formed in San Francisco, California, in 1978. The band was one of the defining punk bands during its initial eight-year run.</p><p>Dead Kennedys' lyrics were usually political in nature, satirizing political figures and authority in general, as well as popular culture and even the punk movement itself. During their initial incarnation between 1978 and 1986, they attracted considerable controversy for their provocative lyrics and artwork. Several stores refused to stock their recordings, provoking debate about censorship in rock music; in the mid-1980s, vocalist and primary lyricist Jello Biafra became an active campaigner against the Parents Music Resource Center. This culminated in an obscenity trial between 1985 and 1986, which resulted in a hung jury.
</p><p>The group released a total of four studio albums and one EP before disbanding in 1986. Following the band's dissolution, Biafra continued to collaborate and record with other artists including D.O.A., NoMeansNo and his own bands Lard and the Guantanamo School of Medicine, as well as releasing several spoken word performances.
</p><p>In 2000 (upheld on appeal in 2003), Biafra lost an acrimonious legal case initiated by his former Dead Kennedys bandmates over songwriting credits and unpaid royalties. In 2001, the band reformed without Biafra; various singers have since been recruited for vocal duties. Although Dead Kennedys have continued to perform live over the years, they have not released any new material since the release of their fourth studio album <i>Bedtime for Democracy</i> in 1986.

<p><b>Opeth</b> is a Swedish progressive metal/rock band from Stockholm, formed in 1990 by lead vocalist David Isberg. The group has been through several personnel changes, including the replacement of every original member; notably Isberg in 1992. Mikael Åkerfeldt has been Opeth's frontman and primary songwriter since Isberg's departure. Opeth has consistently incorporated progressive, folk, blues, classical, and jazz influences into its usually lengthy compositions, as well as strong influences from death metal, especially in their early works. Many songs include acoustic guitar passages and strong dynamic shifts, as well as death growls. Opeth is also well known for their incorporation of Mellotrons in their work. The band rarely made live appearances supporting their first four albums, but since conducting their first world tour after the 2001 release of <i>Blackwater Park</i>, they have led several major world tours.
</p><p>Opeth has released 13 studio albums, four live DVDs, four live albums (three that are in conjunction with DVDs), and two boxsets. The band released its debut album <i>Orchid</i> in 1995. Although their eighth studio album, <i>Ghost Reveries</i>, was quite popular in the United States, Opeth did not experience major American commercial success until the 2008 release of their ninth studio album, <i>Watershed</i>, which peaked at No. 23 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200, and topped the Finnish albums chart in its first week of release. As of November 2009, the band has sold over 1.5 million copies of their albums and DVDs worldwide, including 300,000 collective SoundScans of their albums <i>Blackwater Park</i>, <i>Damnation</i>, and <i>Deliverance</i> in the United States.</p>",Stockholm

<p><b>The Stranglers</b> are an English rock band who emerged via the punk rock scene. Scoring 23 UK top 40 singles and 19 UK top 40 albums to date in a career spanning five decades, the Stranglers are one of the longest-surviving bands to have originated in the UK punk scene.
</p><p>Formed as the Guildford Stranglers in Guildford, Surrey, in early 1974, they originally built a following within the mid-1970s pub rock scene. While their aggressive, no-compromise attitude had them identified by the media with the emerging UK punk rock scene that followed, their idiosyncratic approach rarely followed any single musical genre, and the group went on to explore a variety of musical styles, from new wave, art rock and gothic rock through the sophisti-pop of some of their 1980s output. They had major mainstream success with their 1982 single ""Golden Brown"". Their other hits include ""No More Heroes"", ""Peaches"", ""Always the Sun"", ""Skin Deep"" and ""Big Thing Coming"".
</p><p>The Stranglers' early sound was driven by Jean-Jacques Burnel's melodic bass, but also gave prominence to Dave Greenfield's keyboards. 
Their early music was also characterised by the growling vocals and sometimes misanthropic lyrics of both Burnel and Hugh Cornwell. Over time, their output gradually grew more refined and sophisticated. Summing up their contribution to popular music, critic Dave Thompson later wrote: ""From bad-mannered yobs to purveyors of supreme pop delicacies, the group was responsible for music that may have been ugly and might have been crude – but it was never, ever boring.""</p><p>Keyboard player Dave Greenfield died on 3 May 2020 after contracting COVID-19 while receiving treatment for a heart ailment. The remaining band members completed a new album recorded with Greenfield, <i>Dark Matters</i> following his death and confirmed that they would proceed with their ""Final Full UK Tour"", initially announced in January 2020, in his honour.</p>",Guildford

<p><b>McKinley Morganfield</b> (April 4, 1913  – April 30, 1983), known professionally as <b>Muddy Waters</b>,  was an American blues singer and musician who was an important figure in the post-war blues scene, and is often cited as the ""father of modern Chicago blues"". His style of playing has been described as ""raining down Delta beatitude"".</p><p>Muddy Waters grew up on Stovall Plantation near Clarksdale, Mississippi, and by age 17 was playing the guitar and the harmonica, emulating the local blues artists Son House and Robert Johnson. He was recorded in Mississippi by Alan Lomax for the Library of Congress in 1941. In 1943, he moved to Chicago to become a full-time professional musician. In 1946, he recorded his first records for Columbia Records and then for Aristocrat Records, a newly formed label run by the brothers Leonard and Phil Chess.
</p><p>In the early 1950s, Muddy Waters and his band—Little Walter Jacobs on harmonica, Jimmy Rogers on guitar, Elga Edmonds (also known as Elgin Evans) on drums and Otis Spann on piano—recorded several blues classics, some with the bassist and songwriter Willie Dixon. These songs included ""Hoochie Coochie Man,"" ""I Just Want to Make Love to You"" and ""I'm Ready"". In 1958, he traveled to England, laying the foundations of the resurgence of interest in the  blues there. His performance at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1960 was recorded and released as his first live album, <i>At Newport 1960</i>.
</p><p>Muddy Waters' music has influenced various American music genres, including rock and roll and rock music.

</p><p>Originally active from 1985 to 1996, Crowded House had consistent commercial and critical success in Australia and New Zealand and international chart success in two phases, beginning with a self-titled debut album that reached number 12 on the US Album Chart in 1987 and provided the Top Ten hits ""Don't Dream It's Over"" and ""Something So Strong"". Further international success came in the UK, Europe and South Africa with their third and fourth albums (<i>Woodface</i> and <i>Together Alone</i>) and the compilation album <i>Recurring Dream</i>, which included the hits ""Fall at Your Feet"", ""Weather with You"", ""Distant Sun"", ""Locked Out"", ""Instinct"" and ""Not the Girl You Think You Are"".

<p><b>Ashanti Shequoiya Douglas</b> (born October 13, 1980) is an American singer and actress. She was first discovered as a teenager and later signed to Murder Inc. Records in 2002. That year, she was featured on Fat Joe's ""What's Luv?"" and Ja Rule's ""Always on Time"", both of which became two of the biggest hit songs of 2002. She became the first female artist to occupy the top two positions on the U.S. <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 chart simultaneously with ""Foolish"" and ""What's Luv?"" at numbers one and two, respectively.
</p><p>In 2002, Ashanti released her eponymous debut album, which sold over 505,000 copies throughout the U.S. in its first week of release. The album earned her many awards, including eight <i>Billboard</i> Music Awards, two American Music Awards, and a Grammy Award in 2003 for Best Contemporary R&amp;B Album. The album has since been certified triple platinum in the United States and sold six million copies worldwide by the end of 2003. The lead single for the album, ""Foolish"", was a critical and commercial success; it reached number one on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. With ""Foolish"", she became the second artist (after The Beatles) to have their first three chart entries in the top ten of the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 simultaneously. Ashanti wrote and provided background vocals for Jennifer Lopez's ""Ain't It Funny (Murder Remix)"", which also reached number one on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100.</p><p>In 2003, Ashanti released her second album, <i>Chapter II</i>, which debuted at number one on the <i>Billboard</i> 200, with first-week sales of 326,000 copies in the U.S. The album went platinum, selling over 1.5  a million copies in the U.S. since its release. The album's singles, ""Rock wit U (Awww Baby)"" and ""Rain on Me"", were both commercial successes, peaking at number two and number seven on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 chart, respectively. <i>Chapter II</i> was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary R&amp;B Album, and ""Rock wit U (Awww Baby)"" and ""Rain on Me"" were each nominated in the categories of Best R&amp;B Song and Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance. In November 2003, Ashanti released a Christmas album titled <i>Ashanti's Christmas</i>, which was a modest commercial success.
</p><p>In 2004, Ashanti released her third studio album, <i>Concrete Rose</i>, the title of which took on Tupac Shakur's pseudonym ""The Rose That Grew from Concrete"". The album debuted at number seven in the U.S., with first-week sales of 254,000 copies, and became her third platinum-certified album. The first single, ""Only U"", reached number thirteen on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 and became her biggest hit in the United Kingdom, peaking at number two. A second single, the ballad ""Don't Let Them"", garnered little chart success after Def Jam refused to fund a music video due to Irv Gotti's legal troubles during his money laundering trial. Her subsequent albums include <i>The Declaration</i> (2008) and <i>Braveheart</i> (2014), the latter of which was released independently, on Ashanti's record label, Written Entertainment.
</p><p>Aside from music, Ashanti has also acted in various productions. In 2005, she made her feature film debut in <i>Coach Carter</i> alongside Samuel L. Jackson. She also starred as Dorothy Gale in the made-for-television film <i>The Muppets' Wizard of Oz</i>, which attracted nearly 8 million viewers when it premiered.

<p><b>Bone Thugs-n-Harmony</b> (formerly known as <b>B.O.N.E. Enterprises</b>) is an American hip hop group composed of rappers Bizzy Bone, Wish Bone, Layzie Bone, Krayzie Bone, and Flesh-n-Bone. The group was signed to fellow American rapper Eazy-E‘s Ruthless Records in late 1993, when they debuted with their EP <i>Creepin on ah Come Up</i>. The EP included their breakout hit single ""Thuggish Ruggish Bone"". In 1995, the group released its second album <i>E. 1999 Eternal</i>, which included hits ""1st of tha Month"" and ""East 1999"". Their hit song ""Tha Crossroads"", a tribute to then-recently deceased mentor Eazy-E, won a Grammy Award in 1997. 
</p><p><i>The Art of War</i>, the group's third album, was released in 1997. In 2000, <i>BTNHResurrection</i> reached platinum status in the US in one month, while 2002's <i>Thug World Order</i> received more moderate sales and promotion, going gold and peaking at <abbr title=""Number"">No.</abbr> 3 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. Following that album, the group went on hiatus from their label and released their sixth studio album, <i>Thug Stories</i>, independently in 2006. In 2007, they had another major-label release, <i>Strength &amp; Loyalty</i>, on American producer Swizz Beatz's label Full Surface Records. Bone Thugs-n-Harmony returned with their 2010 album <i>Uni5: The World's Enemy</i>, released by their own record label, BTNH Worldwide, with distribution by Warner Bros.
</p><p>The group is regarded as one of the greatest hip hop acts of all time. Bone Thugs-n-Harmony is the only group that has worked with renowned American rappers 2Pac, the Notorious B.I.G., Eazy-E, and Big Pun while they were all still alive. About.com ranked them <abbr title=""Number"">No.</abbr> 12 on its list of the 25 Best Rap Groups of All Time, and MTV called them ""the most melodic hip-hop group of all time.""</p><p>Due to conflicts within the group, longtime members Krayzie Bone and Wish Bone officially left the group in April 2011 to work with their independent label The Life Entertainment.  They later returned, officially re-unifying the group. In August 2013, however, Layzie Bone announced that he was stepping aside to work more on his solo career. In the same month, BTNH signed with eOne Entertainment (formerly known as Koch Records), with whom they had previously partnered to release 2006's <i>Thug Stories</i>. Layzie Bone has since re-united with the group, and they toured in 2018.

They are currently a trio composed of baritone Nathan Morris alongside tenors Wanyá Morris and Shawn Stockman. During the 1990s, Boyz II Men were a quartet, including bass singer Michael McCary, who left the group in 2003 due to health issues which were eventually diagnosed as multiple sclerosis.</p><p>The group gained international success in 1991, beginning with the release of top 5 singles ""Motownphilly"" and ""It's So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday."" Their number one single ""End of the Road"" was released in 1992, and topped music charts across the globe. ""End of the Road"" set a new record for longevity, holding the number one spot on <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 for thirteen weeks. Boyz II Men broke this record with the subsequent releases of ""I'll Make Love to You"" and ""One Sweet Day"" (with Mariah Carey), which, at fourteen and sixteen weeks, respectively, each set new records for the total number of weeks at number one. ""I'll Make Love to You"" topped the charts in Australia for four weeks and garnered international success.
</p><p>Consequently, Boyz II Men is among the music industry's elite with regard to time spent at number one in <i>Billboard</i> history - with 50 cumulative weeks. They rank sixth behind Drake, the Beatles, Rihanna, Elvis Presley and Carey. Furthermore, when ""On Bended Knee"" took the number one spot away from ""I'll Make Love to You"", Boyz II Men became only the third artists ever (after the Beatles and Presley) to replace themselves at the top of the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. These achievements were enough to earn Boyz II Men recognition as <i>Billboard</i> magazine's biggest boy band during the period of 1987 to 2012. Boyz II Men has received four Grammy Awards.
</p><p>Boyz II Men continue to perform worldwide, as a trio. Their most recent studio album, <i>Under the Streetlight</i>, was released in 2017.</p><p>In June 2017, a section of Broad Street (from Christian to Carpenter Streets) in Philadelphia was renamed ""Boyz II Men Boulevard"".

<p><b>Lacuna Coil</b> is an Italian gothic metal band from Milan. Since their formation in 1994, the group has had two name changes, being previously known as <b>Sleep of Right</b> and <b>Ethereal</b>, and they have recorded nine studio albums, two extended plays, two live albums, two compilation albums, one video album, and sixteen singles and music videos.
</p><p>Inspired by the combination of gothic imagery and music, the members have been known, musically, for composing mid-tempo songs consisting of prominent guitar lines and contrasting dual female/male vocal harmonies to help create a melodic, detached sound. Much of the band's recent material, however, sees a heavier and more down-tuned style, featuring a more distinct bass line and a higher mixing of the guitars within the songs.</p><p>They have toured internationally and were nominated in 2006 for a MTV Europe Music Award. They won the 2012 Metal Female Voices Fest Award for the Best Album, the 2016 Metal Hammer Award for the Best International Band, and the 2018 Metal Hammer Golden Gods Award for Best Live Act. The band's 2012 release, <i>Dark Adrenaline</i>, peaked at number 15 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200. As of March 2012, Lacuna Coil have sold over two million albums worldwide.</p>

</p>

<p><b>Porcupine Tree</b> are  an English rock band formed by musician Steven Wilson in 1987. During an initial career spanning more than twenty years, they earned critical acclaim from critics and fellow musicians, developed a cult following, and became an influence for new artists. The group carved out a career at a certain distance away from mainstream music, being described by publications such as <i>Classic Rock</i> and <i>PopMatters</i> as ""the most important band you’d never heard of"".</p><p>The band began as a solo project for Wilson, who initially created all of the band's music himself. By late 1993, however, he wanted to work in a band environment, bringing on frequent collaborators Richard Barbieri as keyboardist, Colin Edwin as bassist, and Chris Maitland as drummer to form the first permanent lineup. With Wilson as lead vocalist and guitarist, this remained the lineup until February 2002, when Maitland left the band and Gavin Harrison was recruited to replace him. Porcupine Tree's early sound evoked various styles of psychedelic rock, space rock and experimental rock, later moving towards a more progressive/space rock direction comparable to that of Pink Floyd. Upon signing with Kscope record label in the late 1990s, the band began to approach a more mainstream alternative rock sound. By the early 2000s, the band had signed to a major record label and shifted their sound again, this time in a more progressive metal direction. 
</p><p>In 2010, after the tour in support of their 2009 studio album <i>The Incident</i>, the band became publicly inactive as Wilson committed himself to his solo work and other members began working on their own separate projects. However, Wilson, Barbieri and Harrison continued to intermittently work on material in secrecy over the course of the following decade, leading to the release of their album <i>Closure/Continuation</i> on 24 June 2022.

<p><b>Twisted Sister</b> was an American heavy metal band originally from Ho-Ho-Kus, New Jersey, and later based on Long Island, New York. Their best-known songs include ""We're Not Gonna Take It"" and ""I Wanna Rock"", both of which were associated with music videos noted for their sense of slapstick humor.
</p><p>Twisted Sister evolved from a band named Silver Star, and experienced several membership changes before settling on the classic lineup of Jay Jay French (guitars), Eddie ""Fingers"" Ojeda (guitars), Dee Snider (lead vocals), Mark ""The Animal"" Mendoza (bass), and A. J. Pero (drums) in 1982.  It was this lineup which recorded the band's first four albums. Twisted Sister's first two albums, <i>Under the Blade</i> (1982)  and <i>You Can't Stop Rock 'n' Roll</i> (1983), were critically well received and earned the band underground popularity. The band achieved mainstream success with their third album, <i>Stay Hungry</i> (1984), and its single ""We're Not Gonna Take It"", which was their only Top 40 hit on the Billboard Hot 100. Their next two albums, <i>Come Out and Play</i> (1985) and <i>Love Is for Suckers</i> (1987), did not match the success of <i>Stay Hungry</i>, and Twisted Sister disbanded in 1988.
</p><p>The band briefly reunited in the late 1990s before more permanently reforming in 2003. The band released two more albums: <i>Still Hungry</i> (2004), a rerecording of their third album, and the Christmas album, <i>A Twisted Christmas</i> (2006). Following Pero's death in 2015, the band embarked on a farewell tour and broke up again after completing the tour in 2016.
</p><p>Although Twisted Sister is often regarded as glam metal due to its use of makeup, Snider considers the term to be inappropriate. Twisted Sister is also ranked No. 73 among VH1's 100 greatest artists of hard rock.</p>

</p>
<p><b>The Pogues</b> were an English  or Anglo-Irish Celtic punk band fronted by Shane MacGowan and others, founded in King's Cross, London in 1982, as ""Pogue Mahone"" – the anglicisation of the Irish Gaelic <i>póg mo thóin</i>, meaning ""kiss my arse"". The band reached international prominence in the 1980s and early 1990s, recording several hit albums and singles. MacGowan left the band in 1991 owing to drinking problems, but the band continued – first with Joe Strummer and then with Spider Stacy on vocals – before breaking up in 1996. The Pogues re-formed in late 2001, and played regularly across the UK and Ireland and on the US East Coast, until dissolving again in 2014. The group did not record any new material during this second incarnation.
</p><p>Their politically tinged music was informed by MacGowan and Stacy's punk backgrounds, yet used traditional Irish instruments such as the tin whistle, banjo, cittern, mandolin and accordion.

Having appeared as a regular on the television soap opera <i>Another World</i> at age 10, her breakthrough came in the Walt Disney Pictures film <i>The Parent Trap</i> (1998). The film's success led to appearances in the television films <i>Life-Size</i> (2000) and <i>Get a Clue</i> (2002), and the big-screen productions <i>Freaky Friday</i> (2003) and <i>Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen</i> (2004). Lohan's early work won her childhood stardom, while the teen comedy sleeper hit <i>Mean Girls</i> (2004) affirmed her status as a teen idol and established her as a Hollywood leading actress. 
</p><p>Lohan became known as a triple threat after signing with Casablanca Records and releasing two studio albums, the platinum-certified <i>Speak</i> (2004) and gold-certified <i>A Little More Personal (Raw)</i> (2005). She also starred in the comedies <i>Herbie: Fully Loaded</i> (2005) and <i>Just My Luck</i> (2006). In order to showcase her range, Lohan began choosing roles in independent films such as <i>A Prairie Home Companion</i> and <i>Bobby</i> (both 2006) and <i>Chapter 27</i> (2007). Her reported behavior during the filming of the dramedy <i>Georgia Rule</i> in 2006 marked the start of a series of personal struggles that would plague her life and career for most of the next decade. She became a fixture in the tabloid press for her frequent legal issues, court appearances and stints in rehabilitation facilities. This period saw her lose several roles, negatively impacting her career and public image. In an attempt to return to acting, she appeared in <i>Liz &amp; Dick</i> (2012) and <i>The Canyons</i> (2013), but were both met with negative reviews.
</p><p>In 2013, under the guidance of Oprah Winfrey, Lohan filmed the docu-series <i>Lindsay</i> (2014), which depicted her returning to work. She subsequently made her stage debut in the London West End production of <i>Speed-the-Plow</i> (2014), starred in the second season of the comedy series <i>Sick Note</i> (2018), and served as a panelist in the first season of <i>Masked Singer Australia</i> (2019). Between 2016 and 2018, she  opened three beach clubs in Greece, which were the focus of the MTV reality television series <i>Lindsay Lohan's Beach Club</i> (2019). After signing a multi-picture deal with Netflix, Lohan starred in  the romantic comedy <i>Falling for Christmas</i> (2022).</p>",

</p>
<p><b>The Moody Blues</b> were  an English  rock band formed in Birmingham  in 1964, initially consisting of keyboardist Mike Pinder, multi-instrumentalist Ray Thomas, guitarist Denny Laine, drummer Graeme Edge and bassist Clint Warwick. The group came to prominence playing rhythm and blues. They made some changes in musicians but settled on a line-up of Pinder, Thomas, Edge, guitarist Justin Hayward and bassist John Lodge, who stayed together for most of the band's ""classic era"" into the early 1970s. Edge was the group’s sole continuous member throughout their entire history.
</p><p>Their second album, <i>Days of Future Passed</i>, which was released in 1967, was a fusion of rock with classical music which established the band as pioneers in the development of art rock and progressive rock. It has been described as a ""landmark"" and ""one of the first successful concept albums"". The group toured extensively through the early 1970s, then took an extended hiatus from 1974 until 1977. Founder Mike Pinder left the group a year after they re-formed and was replaced by Swiss keyboardist Patrick Moraz in 1978. In the following decade they took on a more synth-pop sound and produced <i>The Other Side of Life</i> in 1986, which made them the first act to earn each of its first three top-10 singles in the United States in a different decade. Health troubles led to a diminished role for founder Ray Thomas throughout the 1980s, although his musical contributions rebounded after Moraz departed in 1991.  Thomas retired from the band in 2002; he died shortly before the band were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2018.
</p><p>The band's last album was the Christmas album <i>December</i> (2003), after which they decided against recording any further studio albums. However, they continued to tour throughout the 2000s and later reunited periodically for events, one-off concerts, short tours and cruises, until Edge's retirement in 2018; he died in 2021.
</p><p>The Moody Blues' most successful singles include ""Go Now"", ""Nights in White Satin"", ""Tuesday Afternoon"", ""Question"", ""Gemini Dream"", ""The Voice"", ""Your Wildest Dreams"" and ""I'm Just a Singer (In a Rock and Roll Band)"". The band has sold 70 million albums worldwide, which includes 18 platinum and gold LPs.

</p>
<p><b>Henry John Deutschendorf Jr.</b> (December 31, 1943 – October 12, 1997), known professionally as <b>John Denver</b>, was an American guitarist, singer, composer, actor, humanitarian, and environmentalist. He is known for popularizing acoustic folk music in the 1970s as part of the ongoing singer-songwriter movement of the mid-to-late 20th century. Denver is widely recognized as a cultural icon of the American West.</p><p>After traveling and living in numerous locations while growing up in his military family, Denver began his music career with folk music groups during the late 1960s. Starting in the 1970s, he was one of the most popular acoustic artists of the decade and one of its best-selling artists. By 1974, he was one of America's best-selling performers; AllMusic has called Denver ""among the most beloved entertainers of his era"".</p><p>Denver recorded and released approximately 300 songs, about 200 of which he composed. He had 33 albums and singles that were certified Gold and Platinum in the U.S by the RIAA, with estimated sales of more than 33 million units. He recorded and performed primarily with an acoustic guitar and sang about his joy in nature, disdain for city life, enthusiasm for music, and relationship trials. Denver's music appeared on a variety of charts, including country music, the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100, and adult contemporary, earning 12 gold and four platinum albums with his signature songs ""Take Me Home, Country Roads"", ""Poems, Prayers &amp; Promises"", ""Annie's Song"", ""Rocky Mountain High"", ""Calypso"", ""Thank God I'm a Country Boy"", and ""Sunshine on My Shoulders"".
</p><p>Denver appeared in several films and television specials during the 1970s and 1980s, including the 1977 hit <i>Oh, God!</i>, in which he starred alongside George Burns. He continued to record into the 1990s, also focusing on environmental issues as well as lending vocal support to space exploration and testifying in front of Congress to protest censorship in music. He lived in Aspen for much of his life, and he was known for his love of Colorado. In 1974, Denver was named poet laureate of the state. The Colorado state legislature also adopted ""Rocky Mountain High"" as one of its two state songs in 2007, and West Virginia did the same for ""Take Me Home, Country Roads"" in 2014.
</p><p>An avid pilot, Denver was killed in a single-fatality crash while piloting a recently purchased light plane in 1997 at age 53.

Born in Cambridge and raised in Start Hill, Essex, she began posting songs on Myspace in 2008, which led to her discovery by a promoter who invited her to perform at warehouse raves.

</p><p>In 2012, Charli XCX rose to prominence with the Icona Pop collaboration ""I Love It"", which became an international success, reaching top 10 in North America and Europe.

Initially the band had a stable lineup, but in 1974, Becker and Fagen retired from live performances to become a studio-only band, opting to record with a revolving cast of session musicians. <i>Rolling Stone</i> has called them ""the perfect musical antiheroes for the seventies"".</p><p>Becker and Fagen played together in a variety of bands from their time together studying at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York.  They later moved to Los Angeles, gathered a band of musicians, and began recording albums.  Their first album, <i>Can't Buy a Thrill</i> (1972),  established a template for their career, blending elements of rock, jazz, Latin music, R&amp;B, blues and sophisticated studio production with cryptic and ironic lyrics.  The band enjoyed critical and commercial success through seven studio albums, peaking with their top-selling album <i>Aja</i>, released in 1977.  After the group disbanded in 1981, Becker and Fagen worked sporadically on solo projects through the 1980s, though a cult following remained devoted to the group's work. Since reuniting in 1993, Steely Dan has toured steadily and released two albums of new material, the first of which, <i>Two Against Nature</i>, earned a Grammy Award for Album of the Year.  Their final album of new studio material was 2003's <i>Everything Must Go</i>, though the band has continued to release compilations, box sets, and live albums on a regular basis.  After Becker's death in 2017, Fagen reluctantly continued the group with himself as the sole official member.
</p><p>They have sold more than 40 million albums worldwide and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in March 2001. VH1 ranked Steely Dan at No. 82 on their list of the 100 Greatest Musical Artists of All Time. <i>Rolling Stone</i> ranked them No. 15 on its list of the 20 greatest duos of all time.</p>",Annandale-on-Hudson

<p><b>Skid Row</b> is an American rock band formed in 1986 in Toms River, New Jersey. Their current lineup comprises bassist Rachel Bolan, guitarists Dave Sabo and Scotti Hill, drummer Rob Hammersmith and vocalist Erik Grönwall. The group achieved commercial success in the late 1980s and early 1990s, with its first two albums <i>Skid Row</i> (1989) and <i>Slave to the Grind</i> (1991) certified multi-platinum, the latter of which reached number one on the <i>Billboard</i> 200. Those two albums also produced some of Skid Row's most popular hits, both in and outside of the United States, including ""18 and Life"" and ""I Remember You"", which peaked in the top 10 of the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100, and other charting singles such as ""Youth Gone Wild"", ""Monkey Business"", ""Slave to the Grind"", ""Wasted Time"", and ""In a Darkened Room"". The band's third album <i>Subhuman Race</i> (1995) was also critically acclaimed, but failed to repeat the success of its predecessors. Those three albums featured the band's ""classic"" lineup, which consisted of Bolan, Sabo, Hill, drummer Rob Affuso and frontman Sebastian Bach. The band had sold 20 million albums worldwide by the end of 1996. Amid rising tensions, Bach and Affuso both left Skid Row towards the end of that year, after which the band entered a three-year hiatus.
</p><p>Skid Row reformed in 1999, with Johnny Solinger as Bach's replacement and a revolving cast of drummers, the latest being Rob Hammersmith. Solinger recorded two albums with the band – <i>Thickskin</i> (2003) and <i>Revolutions per Minute</i> (2006) – as well as the EPs <i>United World Rebellion: Chapter One</i> and <i>Rise of the Damnation Army – United World Rebellion: Chapter Two</i> (2013 and 2014 respectively); those recordings garnered mixed reception. In April 2015, Skid Row announced that they had parted ways with Solinger, and replaced him with former TNT singer Tony Harnell. Eight months later, however, Harnell left the band. In January 2017, former DragonForce vocalist ZP Theart was named the official lead singer after spending a year as a touring member of the group. Theart remained with Skid Row until March 2022, when the band replaced him with current frontman Erik Grönwall. The band's first studio album in 16 years, <i>The Gang's All Here</i>, was released in October 2022.

</p>
<p><b>The B-52's</b> is an American new wave band formed in Athens, Georgia, in 1976. The original lineup consisted of Fred Schneider (vocals, percussion), Kate Pierson (vocals, keyboards, synth bass), Cindy Wilson (vocals, percussion), Ricky Wilson (guitar), and Keith Strickland (drums, guitar, keyboards). Ricky Wilson died of AIDS-related illness in 1985, and Strickland switched from drums to lead guitar. The band also added various members for albums and live performances.
</p><p>The group evoked a ""thrift shop aesthetic"", in Bernard Gendron's words, by drawing from 1950s and 1960s pop sources, trash culture, and rock and roll. Schneider, Pierson, and Wilson sometimes use call-and-response-style vocals (Schneider's often humorous sprechgesang contrasting with Wilson's and Pierson's melodic harmonies), and their guitar- and keyboard-driven instrumentation is their trademark sound, which was also set apart from their contemporaries by the unusual guitar tunings Ricky Wilson used on their earlier albums. The band has had many hits, including ""Rock Lobster"", ""Planet Claire"", ""Party Out of Bounds"", ""Private Idaho"", ""Whammy Kiss"", ""Summer of Love"", ""Wig"", ""Love Shack"", ""Roam"" and ""(Meet) The Flintstones"". They have been nominated for Grammy awards three times: in 1989, 1990 for 'Best Pop Performance By A Duo Or Group With Vocal' and in 1992 for 'Best Alternative Music Album'.

At their peak of commercial success, Feeder won two Kerrang! Awards in 2001 and 2003; they were inducted into their Hall of Fame in August 2019 for “Distinguished Services to Rock”.</p><p>Feeder are one of the Britpop era bands to have continued success long after their peak. Their 2019 album <i>Tallulah</i> debuted at number four, more than two decades after the group formed, and 20 years after their first top 10 album <i>Yesterday Went Too Soon</i>.
</p><p>The band was formed in 1994, although an earlier incarnation under the name of ""Reel"" was formed in 1992 by vocalist and guitarist Grant Nicholas, drummer Jon Lee and bassist Simon Blight, three of the four members of Raindancer, after the departure of that band's other member, guitarist John Canham. However, Blight left Reel later in 1992, and the band played with many session bassists before hiring Taka Hirose in 1994 and re-establishing themselves as Feeder; that year, the band signed with The Echo Label.
</p><p>Feeder garnered media attention in 2001 for their third album, <i>Echo Park</i>, and its lead single, ""Buck Rogers"", which later became a UK top five single. Jon Lee died by suicide at his Miami home in January 2002, after which the remaining members began to record and play with former Skunk Anansie drummer Mark Richardson. They released their fourth album, <i>Comfort in Sound</i>, later that year; it touched on themes such as loss and coming to terms with death, while also exploring themes of positivity. Richardson was ultimately made an official member, remaining so until May 2009 when he returned to a reformed Skunk Anansie. Feeder have since worked with a roster of drummers live and in the studio, including Tim Trotter, Karl Brazil and former Elviss drummer Geoff Holroyde. Between 2010 and 2017, the band charted four more top 20 albums, with the latest of these being 2017's <i>The Best of Feeder</i> their second consecutive top 10 album. In 2019, the band signed a deal with Believe UK to release their tenth studio album, <i>Tallulah</i>.

</p>
<p><b>Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark</b> (<b>OMD</b>) are an English electronic band formed in Wirral, Merseyside, in 1978. The group consists of co-founders Andy McCluskey (vocals, bass guitar) and Paul Humphreys (keyboards, vocals), along with Martin Cooper (keyboards, saxophone) and Stuart Kershaw (drums); McCluskey has been the only constant member. Regarded as pioneers of electronic music, OMD combined an experimental, minimalist ethos with pop sensibilities, becoming key figures in the late-1970s/early-1980s emergence of synth-pop. The band were also one of the original acts involved in the MTV-driven Second British Invasion of the US.
</p><p>McCluskey and Humphreys led precursor group the Id from 1977–1978, and re-recorded their track ""Electricity"" as OMD's debut single in 1979. Weathering an ""uncool"" image and a degree of hostility from music critics, the band achieved popularity throughout Europe with the 1980 anti-war song ""Enola Gay"", and gained further recognition via <i>Architecture &amp; Morality</i> (1981) and its three hit singles. Although later reappraised, <i>Dazzle Ships</i> (1983) was seen as overly experimental, and eroded European support. The group embraced a more radio-friendly sound on <i>Junk Culture</i> (1984); this change in direction led to greater success in the United States, and spawned hits including ""If You Leave"" (from the 1986 film <i>Pretty in Pink</i>).
</p><p>In 1989, creative differences saw Humphreys and other members form the spin-off band the Listening Pool, leaving McCluskey the only remaining member of OMD. The group returned with a new line-up and explored the dance-pop genre: <i>Sugar Tax</i> (1991) and its initial singles were hits in Europe. OMD then began to flounder amid the guitar-oriented grunge and Britpop movements, eventually disbanding in 1996. McCluskey later conceived girl group Atomic Kitten, for whom he served as a principal songwriter and producer, while Humphreys formed the duo Onetwo alongside lead vocalist Claudia Brücken of Propaganda.
</p><p>In 2006, OMD reformed with Humphreys and McCluskey revisiting the experimental territory of their early work; the band have achieved 13 top-20 entries on the UK Albums Chart. Their 20th century output yielded 18 top-40 appearances on the UK Singles Chart, as well as four top-40 entries on the US <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. Although sometimes identified as a cult band, OMD have sold over 40 million records worldwide, and have influenced the work of many other recording artists.

<p><b>Aimee Elizabeth Mann</b> (born September 8, 1960) is an American singer-songwriter. Over the course of four decades, she has released more than a dozen albums as a solo artist and with other musicians. Her work with the producer Jon Brion in the 1990s was influential on American alternative rock, and she is noted for her sardonic and literate lyrics about dark subjects.
</p><p>Mann was born in Richmond, Virginia, and studied at Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts. In the 1980s, after playing with the Young Snakes and Ministry, she co-founded the new wave band 'Til Tuesday and wrote their top-ten single ""Voices Carry"" (1985).

After Geffen refused to release her third album, <i>Bachelor No. 2</i>, Mann self-released it under her own label, SuperEgo Records, in 2000. It received strong sales and critical acclaim, establishing Mann as a career artist who could work outside the major label system.

<p><b>Thelonious Sphere Monk</b> (<span></span>, October 10, 1917 – February 17, 1982) was an American jazz pianist and composer. He had a unique improvisational style and made numerous contributions to the standard jazz repertoire, including ""'Round Midnight"", ""Blue Monk"", ""Straight, No Chaser"", ""Ruby, My Dear"", ""In Walked Bud"", and ""Well, You Needn't"". Monk is the second-most-recorded jazz composer after Duke Ellington.</p><p>Monk's compositions and improvisations feature dissonances and angular melodic twists and are consistent with his unorthodox approach to the piano, which combined a highly percussive attack with abrupt, dramatic use of switched key releases, silences, and hesitations.
</p><p>Monk's distinct look included suits, hats, and sunglasses. He also had an idiosyncratic habit during performances: while other musicians continued playing, Monk would stop, stand up, and dance for a few moments before returning to the piano.</p><p>Monk is one of five jazz musicians to have been featured on the cover of <i>Time</i> (the others being Louis Armstrong, Dave Brubeck, Duke Ellington, and Wynton Marsalis).</p>

<p><b>Underoath</b> (stylized as <b>Underøath</b> or <b>UnderOath</b>) is an American   rock band from Tampa, Florida. It was founded by lead vocalist Dallas Taylor and guitarist Luke Morton on November 30, 1997, in Ocala, Florida; subsequently, its additional members were from Tampa, including drummer, clean vocalist and last remaining core member Aaron Gillespie. The band's current lineup consists of Gillespie, keyboardist Christopher Dudley, lead guitarist Timothy McTague, bassist Grant Brandell, lead vocalist Spencer Chamberlain, and rhythm guitarist James Smith. Originally, the band identified as a Christian group; they have since distanced themselves from Christianity.
</p><p>The band's lineup shifted frequently during its early years. Taylor recorded <i>Act of Depression</i>, <i>Cries of the Past</i>, and <i>The Changing of Times</i> with the band and remained with the group until his departure in 2003; Chamberlain replaced him as lead vocalist, and the lineup has remained mostly stable since. The band then released <i>They're Only Chasing Safety</i> and <i>Define the Great Line</i>, and both earned gold certifications by the RIAA. These two albums remain their most commercially successful releases, and provided them with mainstream status; the latter of the two holds their highest <i>Billboard</i> 200 entry, peaking at no. 2. Following their sixth studio album, <i>Lost in the Sound of Separation</i>, which also reached a top-ten peak on the <i>Billboard</i> 200, Gillespie left the group and was replaced by former Norma Jean drummer Daniel Davison. Their seventh album, <i>Ø (Disambiguation)</i>, was released in 2010; Chamberlain and McTague provided more prominent clean vocals in Gillespie's absence. On October 2, 2012, Underoath announced that they would be disbanding in 2013; they played their final show that January.</p><p>On August 17, 2015, the band announced they had reunited; in doing so, Gillespie returned to the lineup. After performing at A Day to Remember's Self Help Fest in 2016, Underoath announced their eighth studio album, <i>Erase Me</i>, would be released 2018. It was their first album in 8 years and their first in 10 years with Gillespie; the band also publicly abandoned their Christian musical approach starting with this record. The follow-up, <i>Voyeurist</i>, was released in January 2022.

<p><b>Ramón Luis Ayala Rodríguez</b> (born February 3, 1977), known professionally as <b>Daddy Yankee</b>, is a retired Puerto Rican rapper, singer, songwriter, and actor. Known as the ""King of Reggaeton"" by music critics and fans alike, he is the artist who coined the word <i>reggaeton</i> in 1991 in the mixtape Playero 34 in the song ""So persigueme, no te detengas"" to describe the new music genre that was emerging from Puerto Rico that synthesized American hip-hop, Hispanic Caribbean music, and Jamaican reggae rhythms with Spanish rapping and singing. He is often cited as an influence by other Hispanic urban performers.
</p><p>Ayala was born in Río Piedras and was raised in the Villa Kennedy Housing Projects neighborhood. He aspired to be a professional baseball player and tried out for the Seattle Mariners of Major League Baseball. Before he could be officially signed, he was hit by a stray round from an AK-47 rifle while taking a break from a studio recording session with reggaeton artist DJ Playero. Ayala spent roughly a year and a half recovering from the wound; the bullet was never removed from his hip, and he credits the shooting incident with allowing him to focus entirely on a music career.</p><p>In 2004, Daddy Yankee released his international hit single ""Gasolina"", which is credited with introducing reggaeton to audiences worldwide, and making the music genre a global phenomenon. Since then, he has sold around 30 million records, making him one of the best-selling Latin music artists. Daddy Yankee's album <i>Barrio Fino</i> made history when it became the top-selling Latin music album of the decade between 2000 and 2009.</p><p>In 2017, Daddy Yankee, in collaboration with Latin pop singer Luis Fonsi, released the hit single ""Despacito"". It became the first Spanish-language song to hit number one on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 since ""Macarena"" in 1996. The single gained global success. The video for ""Despacito"" on YouTube received its billionth view on April 20, 2017, and became the most-watched video on the platform. Its success led Daddy Yankee to become the most-listened artist worldwide on the streaming service Spotify in June 2017, the first Latin artist to do so. In March 2022, Daddy Yankee announced that he would be retiring from music after the release of his seventh studio album <i>Legendaddy</i> and its supporting tour.</p><p>During his career, Daddy Yankee earned numerous accolades, including five Latin Grammy Awards, two <i>Billboard</i> Music Awards, 14 <i>Billboard</i> Latin Music Awards, two Latin American Music Awards, eight Lo Nuestro Awards, an MTV Video Music Award, and six ASCAP Awards. He also received a Puerto Rican Walk of Fame star, special awards by <i>People en Español</i> magazine, and the Presencia Latina at Harvard University. He was named by CNN as the ""Most Influential Hispanic Artist"" of 2009, and included in <i>Time</i> 100 in 2006.</p>

<p><b>House of Pain</b> was an American hip-hop trio that released three albums in the 1990s. The group consisted of DJ Lethal, Danny Boy, and Everlast. The group's name is a reference to the H. G. Wells novel <i>The Island of Dr. Moreau</i>, a reference carried further by the naming of their 2011 tour <i>He Who Breaks the Law</i>. The group is best known for its 1992 hit single ""Jump Around"", which reached number 3 in their native United States of America, number 6 in Ireland and number 8 in the United Kingdom. The group broke up in 1996 due to what Everlast described as a toxic environment fueled by Danny Boy's drug addiction. Lead rapper Everlast eventually went on to pursue a solo career as a blues rock artist and member of the supergroup La Coka Nostra which also featured DJ Lethal. House of Pain reunited briefly in 2010 for a world tour.

<p><b>Clyde Jackson Browne</b> (born October 9, 1948) is an American musician, singer, songwriter, and political activist who has sold over 18 million records in the United States.</p><p>Emerging as a precocious teenage songwriter in mid-1960s Los Angeles, he experienced his first successes writing songs for others, writing ""These Days"" as a 16-year-old; the song became a minor hit for the German singer and Andy Warhol protégé Nico in 1967. He also wrote several songs for fellow Southern California bands the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, which he was briefly a member in 1966, and the Eagles, the latter of whom had their first US <i>Billboard</i> Top 40 hit in 1972 with the Browne co-written song ""Take It Easy"".
</p><p>Encouraged by his successes writing songs for others, Browne released his self-titled debut album in 1972, which spawned two Top 40 hits of his own, ""Doctor, My Eyes"" and ""Rock Me on the Water"". For his debut album, as well as for the next several albums and concert tours, Browne started working closely with the Section, a prolific session band that also worked with a variety of other prominent singer-songwriters at the time. His second album, <i>For Everyman</i>, was released in 1973, and while it lacked an enduring single, has been retrospectively assessed as some of his best work, appearing highly on several ""Best Album of All Time"" lists. His third album, <i>Late for the Sky</i>, was his most successful to that point, peaking at number 14 on the US <i>Billboard</i> 200 album chart. His fourth album, <i>The Pretender</i>, continued the pattern of each album topping the previous by peaking at number 5 on the album chart, and spawned the hit singles ""Here Come Those Tears Again"" and ""The Pretender"".
</p><p>It would be the 1977 album <i>Running on Empty</i>, however, that would become his signature work, peaking at number 3 on the album chart, and remaining there for over a year. Both a live album and a concept album, the songs on the album explore the themes of life as a touring musician, and the album was recorded both on stage, and in places touring musicians spend time when not playing, such as hotel rooms, backstage, and in one case on a moving tour bus. The album produced two Top 40 singles, ""Running on Empty"" and ""The Load-Out/Stay"", and many of the other tracks became popular radio hits on the AOR format.
</p><p>Successful albums continued through the 1980s, including the 1980 album <i>Hold Out</i>, his only number 1 album, the non-album single ""Somebody's Baby"", which was used in the film <i>Fast Times at Ridgemont High</i>, and 1983's <i>Lawyers in Love</i>, which included the hit single ""Tender Is the Night"". In 1986, he released <i>Lives in the Balance</i>, which had several radio hits and included the introspective ""In the Shape of a Heart"", which was inspired by the suicide of his first wife a decade prior. His string of hit albums came to an end at that point, as his next several albums failed to produce a gold or platinum RIAA rating.
</p><p>He released two compilation albums, <i>The Next Voice You Hear: The Best of Jackson Browne</i> in 1997, and <i>The Very Best of Jackson Browne</i>, released in conjunction with his Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction in 2004. His most recent studio album is 2021's <i>Downhill from Everywhere</i>, the follow-up to 2014's <i>Standing in the Breach</i>, which included the first fully realized version of his song ""The Birds of St. Marks"", a song he had written at age 18. In 2015, <i>Rolling Stone</i> ranked him as 37th in its list of the ""100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time"".</p>",

<p><b>Dirty Pretty Things</b> were an English band fronted by Carl Barât, a member of The Libertines. The formation of the band was announced in September 2005, after a dispute between Barât and Pete Doherty led to the breakup of The Libertines in 2004. Barât had worked with Vertigo Records and had previously revealed that his new project was with the label. Didz Hammond announced he was leaving the Cooper Temple Clause to join the band alongside Libertines drummer Gary Powell and guitarist Anthony Rossomando, who had filled in for Doherty following his departure from The Libertines. They played their first shows in October 2005 in Rome, Italy and Paris, France. They announced their split on 1 October 2008 and played their final shows during November that year.</p><p>After adopting the name Dirty Pretty Things, problems arose - a four-piece band from Salisbury had been playing as ""Dirty Pretty Things"" since early January 2005, claiming to have already trademarked the name in the UK. The two groups came to an agreement over the name, and the other band was renamed Mitchell Devastation. An Australian band had been playing under ""Dirty Pretty Things"" since 2003, although it also opted to change it. The name was shared by Barât's club nights in venues throughout London; they assumed the name ""Bright Young Things"" to avoid confusion.

<p><b>Buzzcocks</b> are an English punk rock band formed in Bolton, England in 1976 by singer-songwriter-guitarist Pete Shelley and singer-songwriter Howard Devoto. They are regarded as a seminal influence on the Manchester music scene, the independent record label movement, punk rock, power pop, and pop punk. They achieved commercial success with singles that fused pop craftsmanship with rapid-fire punk energy. These singles were collected on <i>Singles Going Steady</i>, an acclaimed compilation album described by music journalist and critic, Ned Raggett, as a ""punk masterpiece"".</p><p>Devoto and Shelley chose the name ""Buzzcocks"" after reading the headline, ""It's the Buzz, Cock!"", in a review of the TV series <i>Rock Follies</i> in <i>Time Out</i> magazine. The ""buzz"" is the excitement of playing on stage; ""cock"" is northern English slang meaning ""friend"". They thought it captured the excitement of the nascent punk scene, as well as having humorous sexual connotations following Pete Shelley's time working in a Bolton adult shop.</p><p>Devoto left the band in 1977, after which Pete Shelley became the principal singer-songwriter. After releasing three albums, as well as <i>Singles Going Steady</i>, the band broke up in 1981 following a dispute with their then-record label, but reunited in 1989, since releasing six more albums. Shelley died in 2018, but the band has remained active. Steve Diggle, the guitarist and co-founder of the band, is now singer. They added a new guitarist Mani Perazzoli. They are still touring.

<p><b>Amethyst Amelia Kelly</b> (born 7 June 1990), known professionally as <b>Iggy Azalea</b> (<span></span>), is an Australian rapper, songwriter, and model. At the age of 16, Azalea moved from Australia to the United States in order to pursue a career in music. Azalea earned public recognition after releasing the music videos for her songs ""Pussy"" and ""Two Times"" on YouTube, both of which gained rapid popularity. Azalea shortly after released her debut mixtape, <i>Ignorant Art</i> (2011), and subsequently signed a recording contract with American rapper T.I.'s Grand Hustle label.
</p><p>Azalea's debut studio album, <i>The New Classic</i> (2014), peaked among the top five on several charts worldwide, but received mixed reviews from within the industry. The album eventually topped the <i>Billboard</i> Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums, making Azalea the first non-American female rapper to reach the top of the chart. <i>The New Classic</i> was preceded by Azalea's debut single ""Work"" and chart-topping single ""Fancy"" (featuring Charli XCX), which hit the U.S. <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. Azalea was featured on Ariana Grande's 2014 single ""Problem"", which peaked at number two behind ""Fancy"". With these hits, Azalea became the second musical act (behind The Beatles) act to rank at number one and two simultaneously on the Hot 100 with their debut appearances on the chart. In addition, she achieved three top ten hits simultaneously on the Hot 100 with the aforementioned songs and the album's fifth single, ""Black Widow"" (featuring Rita Ora), which debuted later that year.</p><p>After her debut album, Azalea released a slew of singles to build anticipation for her intended second album, <i>Digital Distortion.</i> However, a series of conflicts with her label, as well as personal conflicts, resulted in the project being cancelled. Consequently, Azalea switched labels, releasing the EP <i>Survive the Summer</i> (2018) under Island Records. Further disagreements led to Azalea becoming an independent artist and creating her own label, Bad Dreams, through a distribution deal with Empire. Her second album, <i>In My Defense</i>, was released in 2019, followed by another EP, <i>Wicked Lips</i>, that same year, and a third studio album, <i>The End of an Era</i>, in 2021.
</p><p>Azalea's accolades include two American Music Awards, three Billboard Music Awards, an MTV Video Music Award, a People's Choice Award, four Teen Choice Awards and four Grammy Award nominations. Azalea's official YouTube channel has accumulated 3.4 billion views, with 15 music videos receiving over 100 million views on Vevo.

The song has received three million spins since its release, according to Broadcast Music Incorporated.</p><p>Signed to DreamWorks Records Nashville in 1998, Keith released his breakthrough single ""How Do You Like Me Now?!"" in late 1999. This song, the title track to his 1999 album of the same name, was the number one country song of 2000, and one of several chart-toppers during his tenure on DreamWorks Nashville. His next three albums, <i>Pull My Chain</i>, <i>Unleashed</i>, and <i>Shock'n Y'all</i>, produced three more number ones each, and all of the albums were certified 4× Platinum. A second Greatest Hits package followed in 2004, and after that, he released <i>Honkytonk University</i>.
</p><p>When DreamWorks closed in 2005, Keith founded the label Show Dog Nashville, which merged with Universal South Records to become Show Dog-Universal Music in December 2009. He has released ten studio albums through Show Dog/Show Dog-Universal: 2006's <i>White Trash with Money</i>, 2007's <i>Big Dog Daddy</i>, 2008's <i>That Don't Make Me a Bad Guy</i>, 2009's <i>American Ride</i>, 2010's <i>Bullets in the Gun</i>, 2011's <i>Clancy's Tavern</i>, 2012's <i>Hope on the Rocks</i>, 2013's <i>Drinks After Work</i>, 2015's <i>35 MPH Town</i>, 2017's <i>The Bus Songs</i>, and 2021's <i>Peso in My Pocket</i>, as well as the compilation <i>35 Biggest Hits</i> in 2008. Keith also made his acting debut in 2006, starring in the film <i>Broken Bridges</i>, and co-starred with comedian Rodney Carrington in the 2008 film <i>Beer for My Horses</i>, inspired by his song of the same name.
</p><p>Keith has released 19 studio albums, 2 Christmas albums, and 5 compilation albums, totaling worldwide sales of over 40 million albums. He has charted 61 singles on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot Country Songs charts, including 20 number one hits and 22 additional top 10 hits.

<p><b>Leftfield</b> are a British electronic music group formed in 1989 a duo of Neil Barnes and Paul Daley (the latter formerly of the Rivals and A Man Called Adam). The duo was influential in the evolution of electronic music in the 1990s, with <i>Mixmag</i> describing them as ""the single most influential production team working in British dance music"". As with many of their contemporaries, such as the Chemical Brothers and Fatboy Slim, Leftfield are notable for their use of guest vocalists in their works. Among them were Toni Halliday on ""Original"", Johnny Rotten on ""Open Up"", Djum Djum on ""Afro-Left"", and Earl 16 and Cheshire Cat on ""Release the Pressure"". The term progressive house was coined to define their style, a fusion of house with dub and reggae.</p><p>There was a hiatus in recording and live performances between 2002 and 2010. When Barnes revived Leftfield, Daley declined to be involved, to focus on his solo career. After touring for a few years, Barnes finished writing new material for a third Leftfield album, <i>Alternative Light Source</i>. In 2022, they released their fourth studio album titled <i>This Is What We Do</i>.

<p><b>Antonín Leopold Dvořák</b> (<span></span> <i title=""English pronunciation respelling"">d(ə-<span>)VOR</span>-zha(h)k</i>; <small>Czech: </small><span title=""Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)"" lang=""cs-Latn-fonipa"">[ˈantoɲiːn ˈlɛopold ˈdvor̝aːk]</span> <span></span>; 8 September 1841 – 1 May 1904) was a Czech composer. Dvořák frequently employed rhythms and other aspects of the folk music of Moravia and his native Bohemia, following the Romantic-era nationalist example of his predecessor Bedřich Smetana. Dvořák's style has been described as ""the fullest recreation of a national idiom with that of the symphonic tradition, absorbing folk influences and finding effective ways of using them"".</p><p>Dvořák displayed his musical gifts at an early age, being an apt violin student from age six. The first public performances of his works were in Prague in 1872 and, with special success, in 1873, when he was 31 years old. Seeking recognition beyond the Prague area, he submitted a score of his First Symphony to a prize competition in Germany, but did not win, and the unreturned manuscript was lost until it was rediscovered many decades later. In 1874, he made a submission to the Austrian State Prize for Composition, including scores of two further symphonies and other works. Although Dvořák was not aware of it, Johannes Brahms was the leading member of the jury and was highly impressed. The prize was awarded to Dvořák in 1874 and again in 1876 and in 1877, when Brahms and the prominent critic Eduard Hanslick, also a member of the jury, made themselves known to him. Brahms recommended Dvořák to his publisher, Simrock, who soon afterward commissioned what became the <i>Slavonic Dances</i>, Op. 46. These were highly praised by the Berlin music critic Louis Ehlert in 1878, the sheet music (of the original piano 4-hands version) had excellent sales, and Dvořák's international reputation was launched at last.
</p><p>Dvořák's first piece of a religious nature, his setting of Stabat Mater, was premiered in Prague in 1880. It was very successfully performed in London in 1883, leading to many other performances in the United Kingdom and United States. In his career, Dvořák made nine invited visits to England, often conducting performances of his own works. His Seventh Symphony was written for London. Visiting Russia in March 1890, he conducted concerts of his own music in Moscow and Saint Petersburg. In 1891, Dvořák was appointed as a professor at the Prague Conservatory. In 1890–91, he wrote his <i>Dumky Trio</i>, one of his most successful chamber music pieces.
</p><p>In 1892, Dvořák moved to the United States and became the director of the National Conservatory of Music of America in New York City. The President of the National Conservatory of Music in America, Jeannette Thurber, offered Dvořák an annual salary of $15,000 – an incredibly lavish sum for the era (equivalent to $452,389 in 2021), twenty-five times what he was paid at the Prague Conservatory. While in the United States, Dvořák wrote his two most successful orchestral works: the Symphony <i>From the New World</i>, which spread his reputation worldwide, and his Cello Concerto, one of the most highly regarded of all cello concerti.
</p><p>In the summer of 1893, Dvořák moved from New York City to Spillville, Iowa, following the advice of his secretary, J.J. Kovarík. Dvořák had originally planned to come back to Bohemia, but Spillville was made up of mostly Czech immigrants, and thus he felt less homesick; Dvořák referred to it as his ""summer Vysoka."" This is where he wrote his most famous piece of chamber music, his String Quartet in F major, Op. 96, which was later nicknamed the <i>American Quartet</i>. Shortly after his time in Iowa, Dvořák extended his contract at the National Conservatory for another two years. However, the economic crisis of April 1893 resulted in Thurber's husband's loss of income, and directly influenced the National Conservatory's funding. Shortfalls in payment of his salary, along with increasing recognition in Europe and an onset of homesickness, led him to leave the United States and return to Bohemia in 1895.
</p><p>All of Dvořák's nine operas, except his first, have librettos in Czech and were intended to convey the Czech national spirit, as were some of his choral works. By far the most successful of the operas is <i>Rusalka</i>. Among his smaller works, the seventh <i>Humoresque</i> and the song ""Songs My Mother Taught Me"" are also widely performed and recorded. He has been described as ""arguably the most versatile... composer of his time"".</p><p>The Dvořák Prague International Music Festival is a major series of concerts held annually to celebrate Dvořák's life and works.</p>",

<p><b>The Specials</b>, also known as <b>The Special AKA</b>, are an English 2 tone and ska revival band formed in 1977 in Coventry. After some early changes, the first stable lineup of the group consisted of Terry Hall and Neville Staple on vocals, Jerry Dammers on keyboards, Lynval Golding and Roddy Radiation on guitars, Horace Panter on bass, John Bradbury on drums, and Dick Cuthell and Rico Rodriguez on horns.  Their music combines the danceable rhythms of ska and rocksteady with the energy and attitude of punk. Lyrically, their work (often written by primary songwriter Dammers) presented overt political and social commentary.
</p><p>The band wore mod-style ""1960s period rude boy outfits (pork pie hats, tonic and mohair suits and loafers)"". In 1980, the song ""Too Much Too Young"", the lead track on their <i>The Special AKA Live!</i> EP, reached No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart. In 1981, the recession-themed single ""Ghost Town"" also hit No. 1 in the UK. After seven consecutive UK top 10 singles between 1979 and 1981, main lead vocalists Hall and Staple, along with guitarist Golding, left to form Fun Boy Three. Continuing as ""The Special AKA"" (a name they used frequently on earlier Specials releases), a substantially revised Specials line-up issued new material until 1984, including the top 10 UK hit single ""Free Nelson Mandela"". After this, founder Jerry Dammers dissolved the band and pursued political activism. The group re-formed in 1993, and have continued to perform and record with varying line-ups, none of them involving Dammers.

Mingus's work ranged from advanced bebop and avant-garde jazz with small and midsize ensembles – pioneering the post-bop style on seminal recordings like <i>Pithecanthropus Erectus</i> (1956) and <i>Mingus Ah Um</i> (1959) – to progressive big band experiments such as <i>The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady</i> (1963).
</p><p>Mingus's compositions continue to be played by contemporary musicians ranging from the repertory bands Mingus Big Band, Mingus Dynasty, and Mingus Orchestra, to the high school students who play the charts and compete in the Charles Mingus High School Competition. In 1993, the Library of Congress acquired Mingus's collected papers—including scores, sound recordings, correspondence and photos—in what they described as ""the most important acquisition of a manuscript collection relating to jazz in the Library's history"".</p>",

<p><b>Dexys Midnight Runners</b> (currently officially <b>Dexys</b>, their former nickname, styled without an apostrophe) are an English pop rock band from Birmingham, with soul influences, who achieved major commercial success in the early to mid-1980s. They are best known in the UK for their songs ""Come On Eileen"" and ""Geno"", both of which peaked at No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart, as well as six other top-20 singles. ""Come On Eileen"" also topped the US <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100, and with extensive airplay on MTV they are associated with the Second British Invasion.</p><p>During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Dexys went through numerous personnel changes over the course of three albums and 13 singles, with only singer/songwriter/co-founder Kevin Rowland remaining in the band through all of the transitions and only Rowland and ""Big"" Jim Paterson (trombone) appearing on all of the albums. By 1985, the band consisted only of Rowland and long-standing members Helen O'Hara (violin) and Billy Adams (guitar). The band broke up in 1987, with Rowland becoming a solo artist. After two failed restart attempts, Dexys was reformed by Rowland in 2003 with new members, as well as a few returning members from the band's original lineup (known as Dexys Mark I). Dexys released their fourth album in 2012 and a fifth followed in 2016.

</p>
<p><b>Primus</b> is an American rock band formed in El Sobrante, California in 1984. The band is currently composed of bassist/vocalist Les Claypool, guitarist Larry ""Ler"" LaLonde, and drummer Tim ""Herb"" Alexander. Primus originally formed in 1984 with Claypool and guitarist Todd Huth, later joined by drummer Jay Lane, though the latter two departed the band at the beginning of 1989, and were replaced by LaLonde and Alexander respectively.
</p><p>The ""classic"" lineup of Claypool, LaLonde and Alexander debuted with the live album <i>Suck on This</i>, which was self-released in 1989 on Claypool's label Prawn Song and reissued a year later by Caroline Records. Caroline also released Primus' debut studio album <i>Frizzle Fry</i> (1990), which was critically well received and its underground success led to interest from major record labels. Their second studio album and major-label debut <i>Sailing the Seas of Cheese</i> (1991), released through Interscope Records, launched the band into mainstream exposure, supported by their first charting single ""Jerry Was a Race Car Driver"" and receiving platinum certification within a decade after its release. Primus repeated its success with their next two albums, <i>Pork Soda</i> (1993) and <i>Tales from the Punchbowl</i> (1995), both charting in the top ten on the <i>Billboard</i> 200, and being certified platinum and gold respectively by the RIAA; the former album featured the band's top ten hit on the <i>Billboard</i> rock chart, ""My Name Is Mud"", while the latter's lead single ""Wynona's Big Brown Beaver"" has the distinction of being their only song to chart anywhere outside of North America.</p><p>Alexander left the band in 1996, and was replaced by Bryan ""Brain"" Mantia, with whom Primus recorded two more studio albums – <i>Brown Album</i> (1997) and <i>Antipop</i> (1999) – as well as the covers EP <i>Rhinoplasty</i> (1998) and the original theme song for the TV show <i>South Park</i>. The band went on hiatus in 2000 but resumed activity in 2003, reuniting with Alexander for the EP/DVD <i>Animals Should Not Try to Act Like People</i> and touring sporadically throughout the 2000s before Alexander once again left in 2010. Lane rejoined the band and appeared on their seventh studio album – and first in twelve years – <i>Green Naugahyde</i> (2011). Following Lane's departure in 2013, Alexander returned to the band once again and Primus has since recorded two more albums with him – <i>Primus &amp; the Chocolate Factory with the Fungi Ensemble</i> (2014) and <i>The Desaturating Seven</i> (2017) – as well as the EP <i>Conspiranoid</i> (2022).
</p><p>Primus is characterized by its irreverent, quirky approach to music distinguished by Claypool's bass-first songwriting style and eccentric lyrical themes. In 1993, Robert Christgau remarked: ""[Primus is] quite possibly the strangest top-10 band ever, and good for them.""</p>

</p>
<p><b>The Chicks</b> (previously known as <b>Dixie Chicks</b>) are an American country music band from Dallas, Texas. Since 1995, the band has consisted of Natalie Maines (lead vocals, guitar) and sisters Martie Maguire (vocals, fiddle, mandolin, guitar) and Emily Strayer (vocals, guitar, banjo, Dobro). Maguire and Strayer, both née Erwin, founded the band in 1989 in Dallas, Texas, with bassist Laura Lynch and vocalist and guitarist Robin Lynn Macy. They performed bluegrass and country music, busking and touring the bluegrass festival circuits and small venues for six years without attracting a major label. In 1992, Macy left and Lynch became the lead vocalist. 
</p><p>Upon signing with Monument Records Nashville in 1997 and replacing Lynch with Maines, the Chicks achieved success with their albums <i>Wide Open Spaces</i> (1998) and <i>Fly</i> (1999). After Monument closed its Nashville branch, the Chicks moved to Columbia Records for <i>Home</i> (2002). These albums achieved multi-platinum sales in the United States, Canada, and Australia, along with several charting singles on the American <i>Billboard</i> Hot Country Songs charts. ""There's Your Trouble"", ""Wide Open Spaces"", ""You Were Mine"", ""Cowboy Take Me Away"", ""Without You"", and a cover of Bruce Robison's ""Travelin' Soldier"" reached number one. The Chicks also reached number one on the Adult Contemporary chart with their 2002 cover of Fleetwood Mac's ""Landslide"".
</p><p>Days before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Maines told a London audience that the Chicks did not endorse the war and were ashamed of US President George W. Bush being from Texas. The remarks triggered boycotts in the US and a backlash from fans. After a hiatus, the Chicks released <i>Taking the Long Way</i> in 2006, an album informed by the backlash. ""Not Ready to Make Nice"" became their biggest crossover single, reaching number four on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. After another hiatus, Maguire and Strayer released an album in 2009 as the Court Yard Hounds. The Chicks reunited to tour in the 2010s. In 2020, they removed ""Dixie"" from their name, citing negative connotations, and released their first album in 14 years, <i>Gaslighter.</i>
</p><p>The Chicks have won 13 Grammy Awards, including five in 2007 for <i>Taking the Long Way,</i> which received the Grammy Award for Album of the Year, and its single ""Not Ready to Make Nice"", which received the Grammy Award for Record of the Year and the Grammy Award for Song of the Year. By July 2020, with 33 million certified albums sold and sales of 27.9 million albums in the US, the Chicks had become the best-selling all-woman band and best-selling country group in the US during the Nielsen SoundScan era (1991–present).</p>",Dallas

<p><b>Stanley Getz</b> (February 2, 1927 – June 6, 1991) was an American jazz saxophonist. Playing primarily the tenor saxophone, Getz was known as ""The Sound"" because of his warm, lyrical tone, with his prime influence being the wispy, mellow timbre of his idol, Lester Young. Coming to prominence in the late 1940s with Woody Herman's big band, Getz is described by critic Scott Yanow as ""one of the all-time great tenor saxophonists"". Getz performed in bebop and cool jazz groups. Influenced by João Gilberto and Antônio Carlos Jobim, he also helped popularize bossa nova in the United States with the hit 1964 single ""The Girl from Ipanema"".

<p><b>Frankie Goes to Hollywood</b> were an English synth-pop band formed in Liverpool in 1980. The group's best-known line-up comprised Holly Johnson (vocals), Paul Rutherford (backing vocals), Peter Gill (drums, percussion), Mark O'Toole (bass guitar) and Brian Nash (guitar).
</p><p>The group's 1983 debut single ""Relax"" was banned by the BBC in 1984 while at number six in the charts and subsequently topped the UK Singles Chart for five consecutive weeks, going on to enjoy prolonged chart success throughout that year and ultimately becoming the seventh-best-selling UK single of all time. It also won the 1985 Brit Award for Best British Single. Their debut album, <i>Welcome to the Pleasuredome</i>, reached number one in the UK in 1984 with advanced sales of more than one million. After the follow-up success of ""Two Tribes"" and ""The Power of Love"", the group became only the second act in the history of the UK charts to reach number one with their first three singles; the first being fellow Liverpudlians Gerry and the Pacemakers in the 1960s. This record remained unbeaten until the Spice Girls achieved a six-single streak in 1996–1997.
</p><p>In 1985 the band won the Brit Award for British Breakthrough Act. Associated with the Second British Invasion of the US, they also received Grammy Award and MTV Video Music Award nominations for Best New Artist.

<p><b>Alfred Matthew</b> ""<b>Weird Al</b>"" <b>Yankovic</b> (<span></span> <i title=""English pronunciation respelling""><span>YANG</span>-kə-vik</i>; born October 23, 1959) is an American singer, musician, songwriter, record producer, actor and author. He is best known for creating comedy songs that make light of pop culture and often parody specific songs by contemporary musicians. He also performs original songs that are style pastiches of the work of other acts, as well as polka medleys of several popular songs, most of which feature his trademark accordion.
</p><p>Since having a comedy song aired on <i>The Dr. Demento Radio Show</i> in 1976 at age 16, Yankovic has sold more than 12 million albums (as of 2015), recorded more than 150 parodies and original songs, and performed more than 1,000 live shows. His work has earned him five Grammy Awards and a further 11 nominations, four gold records, and six platinum records in the U.S. His first top ten <i>Billboard</i> album (<i>Straight Outta Lynwood</i>) and single (""White &amp; Nerdy"") were both released in 2006, nearly three decades into his career. His latest album, <i>Mandatory Fun</i> (2014), became his first number-one album during its debut week.
</p><p>Yankovic's success comes in part from his effective use of music videos to further parody pop culture, the song's original artist, and the original music videos themselves, scene-for-scene in some cases. He directed later videos himself and went on to direct for other artists, including Ben Folds, Hanson, the Black Crowes, and the Presidents of the United States of America. With the decline of music television and the onset of social media, he used YouTube and other video sites to publish his videos; this strategy helped to boost sales of his later albums. Yankovic has stated that he may forgo traditional albums in favor of timely releases of singles from the 2010s onwards.
</p><p>In addition to recording his albums, Yankovic wrote and starred in the film <i>UHF</i> (1989) and the television series <i>The Weird Al Show</i> (1997). He has produced two satirical films about his own life, <i>The Compleat Al</i> (1985) and <i>Weird: The Al Yankovic Story</i> (2022). He has also made guest appearances and performed voice acting roles on many television shows and video web content, in addition to starring in <i>Al TV</i> specials on MTV. He has also written two children's books, <i>When I Grow Up</i> (2011) and <i>My New Teacher and Me!</i> (2013).

<p><b>Bobby Darin</b> (born <b>Walden Robert Cassotto</b>; May 14, 1936 – December 20, 1973) was an American musician and actor. He performed jazz, pop, rock and roll, folk, swing, and country music.
</p><p>He started his career as a songwriter for Connie Francis. He recorded his first million-selling single, ""Splish Splash"", in 1958. That was followed by ""Dream Lover"", ""Mack the Knife"", and ""Beyond the Sea"", which brought him worldwide fame. In 1962, he won a Golden Globe Award for his first film, <i>Come September</i>, co-starring his first wife, actress Sandra Dee.
</p><p>During the 1960s, he became more politically active and worked on Robert F. Kennedy's Democratic presidential campaign. He was present at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles at the time of Robert Kennedy's assassination in June 1968. During the same year, he discovered the woman who had raised him was his grandmother, not his mother as he thought, and learned that the woman he thought was his sister was actually his mother. Those events deeply affected Darin and sent him into a long period of seclusion.</p><p>Although he made a successful comeback (in television) in the early 1970s, his health was beginning to fail following bouts of rheumatic fever in childhood. The knowledge of his vulnerability had always spurred him on to use his musical talent while still young. He died at the age of 37 after a heart operation in Los Angeles in 1973.</p>",

<p><b>Haim</b> (<span></span> <i title=""English pronunciation respelling""><span>HY</span>-im</i>; meaning ""life"" in Hebrew, stylized <b>HAIM</b>) is an American rock band, based in Los Angeles and comprising three sisters, Este (bass guitar and vocals), Danielle (lead vocals, guitar, and drums), and Alana Haim (guitars, keyboards, and vocals). In addition to their primary instruments, each is proficient in several others. The group's pop sound on their studio work stands in contrast to the more rock-oriented sound of their live shows.
</p><p>The sisters grew up in a musical family, and began playing instruments from an early age in the cover band Rockinhaim, fronted by their parents, Moti and Donna. The two elder sisters, Este and Danielle, performed briefly with the pop group Valli Girls in 2005, releasing a few songs on soundtrack and compilation albums under that name. In 2007, they formed Haim with younger sister Alana, but did not seriously consider it a professional career for some years. After Danielle became a successful touring guitarist, first with Jenny Lewis and later with Julian Casablancas, Haim reformed as a full-time operation in 2012.
</p><p>The group's first release, <i>Forever</i> (an EP released as a limited-time download), combined with positive reception at the South by Southwest festival, led to a deal with Polydor Records and a management deal with Jay-Z's Roc Nation group in mid-2012. The band began recording material for their first album, <i>Days Are Gone</i> (2013), in sessions between touring dates, including appearances at the Glastonbury Festival. The album charted in the top ten in several countries, including the number-one spot in the UK, and the group had won several ""best of"" awards by the end of 2013. The group was nominated for Best New Artist at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards. Their second album, <i>Something to Tell You</i>, was released in July 2017. Their third album, titled <i>Women in Music Pt. III</i>, was released in June 2020. The group received nominations at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards for Album of the Year (for <i>Women in Music Pt.

<p><b>Solange Piaget Knowles</b> (<span></span>; born June 24, 1986) is an American singer, songwriter, performance artist, and actress. Expressing an interest in music from an early age, Knowles had several temporary stints as a backup dancer for Destiny's Child, which featured her elder sister, Beyoncé Knowles, among its members, before signing with her father Mathew Knowles's Music World Entertainment label. At age 16, Knowles released her first studio album <i>Solo Star</i> (2002). She also appeared in the films <i>Johnson Family Vacation</i> (2004), and <i>Bring It On: All or Nothing</i> (2006). 
</p><p>In 2007, Knowles began to record music again. Heavily influenced by Motown girl groups, her second studio album <i>Sol-Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams</i> (2008) deviated from the pop-oriented music of her debut to Motown-inspired sounds from the 60's and 70's. It peaked at number nine on the US <i>Billboard</i> 200 and received positive reviews from critics. She followed this up with the 1980s pop and R&amp;B-inspired extended play <i>True</i> (2012) on Terrible Records and her imprint Saint Records. Her third studio album, <i>A Seat at the Table</i> (2016) was released to widespread critical acclaim and became her first number-one album in the United States. The album's lead single, ""Cranes in the Sky"" won the Grammy for Best R&amp;B Performance. Her fourth studio album, <i>When I Get Home</i>, was released in March 2019 to further critical acclaim.
</p><p>Knowles says that her first passion is songwriting. Frequently compared by the media to her sister Beyoncé, Knowles has claimed that they have different aspirations and are musically different. She has been ranked by <i>Billboard</i> as the 100th most successful dance artist of all-time, and in 2017 was honored with the ""Impact Award"" at the <i>Billboard</i> Women in Music event. Her other ventures include an endorsement deal with Rimmel London and a line of hip-hop-oriented merchandise for young children.
</p><p>Knowles has also ventured into performance art, working in several international museums and exhibitions, such as the Elbphilharmonie, the Venice Art Biennale and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. In 2022, Knowles became the third woman and first African American to compose a score for the New York City Ballet.

<p><b>Robert William Gary Moore</b> (4 April 1952 – 6 February 2011) was a Northern Irish musician. Over the course of his career he played in various groups and performed a range of music including blues, blues rock, hard rock, heavy metal, and jazz fusion.
</p><p>Influenced by Peter Green and Eric Clapton, Moore began his career in the late 1960s when he joined Skid Row, with whom he released two albums. After Moore left the group he joined Thin Lizzy, featuring his former Skid Row bandmate and frequent collaborator Phil Lynott. Moore began his solo career in the 1970s and achieved major success with 1978's ""Parisienne Walkways"", which is considered his signature song. During the 1980s, Moore transitioned into playing hard rock and heavy metal with varying degrees of international success. In 1990, he returned to his roots with <i>Still Got the Blues</i>, which became the most successful album of his career. Moore continued to release new music throughout his later career, collaborating with other artists from time to time. Moore died on 6 February 2011 from a heart attack while on holiday in Spain.
</p><p>Moore was often described as a virtuoso and has been cited as an influence by many other guitar players. He was voted as one of the greatest guitarists of all time on respective lists by <i>Total Guitar</i> and <i>Louder</i>. Irish singer-songwriter Bob Geldof said that ""without question, [Moore] was one of the great Irish bluesmen"". For most of his career, Moore was heavily associated with Peter Green's famed 1959 Gibson Les Paul guitar. Later he was honoured by Gibson and Fender with several signature model guitars.

<p><b>Funeral for a Friend</b> are a Welsh rock band from Bridgend, formed in 2001 and currently consists of Matthew Davies-Kreye (lead vocals), Kris Coombs-Roberts (guitar, backing vocals), Gavin Burrough (guitar, backing vocals), Darran Smith (guitar), Richard Boucher (bass), and Ryan Richards (drums, vocals).
</p><p>Funeral for a Friend's popularity rose in the United Kingdom with the release of their debut album, <i>Casually Dressed &amp; Deep in Conversation</i> (2003). Achieving both a gold certification and three top-twenty singles in their home country, <i>Casually Dressed &amp; Deep in Conversation</i> is often acclaimed as one of the landmark emo records of the 2000s. <i>Hours</i> (2005) featured a similar musical style to their debut, but also featured more melodic sensibilities, and <i>Tales Don't Tell Themselves</i> (2007) showed an evolution in Funeral for a Friend's musical style from that which defined their debut, as the group began to diverge from their use of screaming vocals and post-hardcore-influenced guitars, favoring a more melodic rock influence. These albums achieved gold and silver sales certificates respectively in the UK.
</p><p>Funeral for a Friend self-released their fourth album, <i>Memory and Humanity</i> (2008) through their short-lived record label <i>Join Us</i>, the album arguably being their most eclectic to date. Following this the band tied themselves to other independent labels for <i>Welcome Home Armageddon</i> (2011)  <i>Conduit</i> (2013), and <i>Chapter and Verse</i> (2015), which showed the band returning to the heavier style of their earlier work. In September 2015, they announced their break-up and final tour in 2016. On 21 May 2016, they played their last performance to a sold-out Forum in London.
</p><p>In October 2019, Funeral for a Friend reunited as a live band, initially for three benefit shows – two in Cardiff at the Cardiff University Student Union followed by one in London at Shepherd's Bush Empire. Following a planned performance at the canceled 2020 Download Festival, they announced a headline UK tour for April 2021 playing songs from their first three albums.

<p><b>Pennywise</b> is an American punk rock band from Hermosa Beach, California, formed in 1988. The band took its name from the antagonist in Stephen King's horror novel <i>It</i> known as Pennywise the Dancing Clown.</p><p>Between their 1991 self-titled debut and 2005's <i>The Fuse</i>, Pennywise released an album every two years on Epitaph Records, a label owned by Bad Religion guitarist Brett Gurewitz. To date, the band has released twelve full-length studio albums, one live album, two EPs and one DVD. Although their first two studio albums were critically acclaimed, Pennywise would not experience worldwide commercial success until the 1995 release of their third studio album, <i>About Time</i>, which peaked at number ninety-six on the Billboard 200, and number fifty-five on Australia's ARIA Charts. The band's mainstream success coincided with a growing interest in punk rock during the 1990s, along with fellow California bands NOFX, Rancid, Blink-182, Bad Religion, Green Day, The Offspring, Lagwagon and Sublime. By 2007, the band had independently sold over three million records worldwide.</p><p>Pennywise's current line-up consists of Jim Lindberg (vocals), Fletcher Dragge (guitars), Randy Bradbury (bass) and Byron McMackin (drums). They had kept their original line-up together until bassist Jason Thirsk died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in 1996, due to issues with his alcoholism, after which Bradbury joined as his replacement. In August 2009, Lindberg decided to leave the band; he was replaced in February 2010 by Ignite singer Zoli Téglás. With Téglás, the band recorded their tenth studio album <i>All or Nothing</i>, which was released on May 1, 2012. Lindberg rejoined the band later that year after Téglás was sidelined by a back injury.

They became one of the most successful groups of the New Romantic era of British pop and were part of the Second British Invasion of the <i>Billboard</i> Top 40 in the 1980s, selling 25 million albums and having 23 hit singles worldwide. The band have had eight UK top 10 albums, including three greatest hits compilations and an album of re-recorded material. Their musical influences ranged from punk rock and soul music to the American crooners Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett.</p><p>The band's classic lineup featured Gary Kemp on guitar, synthesiser and backing vocals, his brother Martin Kemp on bass, vocalist Tony Hadley, saxophonist Steve Norman and drummer John Keeble. Gary Kemp was also the band's songwriter. Their debut single ""To Cut a Long Story Short"" reached No. 5 in the UK in 1980 and was the first of ten UK top-10 singles. The band peaked in popularity in 1983 with the album <i>True</i>, as its title track reached No. 1 in the UK and the top 5 in the US. In 2011, it received a BMI award as one of the most-played songs in US history with four million airplays. In 1984, they received a Brit Award for technical excellence and were the first act to be approached by Bob Geldof to join the original Band Aid lineup. In 1985, they performed at the Live Aid benefit concert at Wembley Stadium.
</p><p>In 1990, the band played their last live show before a 19-year absence. In 1999, Hadley, Norman and Keeble launched an unsuccessful case in the High Court against Gary Kemp and his Reformation Publishing Company for a share of the band's songwriting royalties. Spandau Ballet reformed in 2009 for The Reformation Tour, a sell-out ""greatest hits"" world tour. In 2014, their archive-only feature-length documentary biopic, <i>Soul Boys of the Western World</i>, was world-premiered at SXSW Film Festival in Austin, Texas. It was officially screened at the Rome, Ghent (Belgium) and NYC Doc film festivals and received its European premiere at the Royal Albert Hall, London.
</p><p>In 2017, Hadley left Spandau Ballet. A year later, singer and actor Ross William Wild became their new frontman for a series of European live dates and a one-off show at Eventim's Hammersmith Apollo. In May 2019, Wild tweeted that he had quit the band ""to pursue my own music with my band Mercutio"", while Spandau bass player Martin Kemp confirmed there were no further plans for Spandau to tour without original singer Hadley.</p>",Islington

Remembered for a rapid rise to fame, Hammer has also been an entrepreneur and celebrity spokesperson.</p><p>A multi-award winner, Hammer is considered a ""forefather"" and pioneering innovator of pop rap (incorporating elements of freestyle music), and is the first hip hop artist to achieve diamond status for an album. After being labeled a sellout, and with the changing landscape of hip hop music, Hammer attempted to appeal to the rise of gangsta rap. However, due to overexposure and critical backlash, his popularity waned by the mid-1990s (which led to a highly publicized bankruptcy beginning in 1996).</p><p>Along with a Mattel doll and other merchandise, Hammer starred in a Saturday-morning cartoon called <i>Hammerman</i> in 1991. He became an ordained preacher during the late 1990s and hosted <i>M.C. Hammer and Friends</i>, a Christian ministry program on TBN. Hammer was also a dance judge on <i>Dance Fever</i> in 2003, was the co-creator of the dance website DanceJam.com, and was executive producer of his own reality show titled <i>Hammertime</i> (which aired on the A&amp;E Network during the summer of 2009).</p><p>Throughout his career, Hammer has managed his own recording business as a record label CEO. As a result, he has created and produced his own acts/music including: Ho Frat Hoo!, Oaktown's 3.5.7, Special Generation, Analise, DRS, B Angie B, Gentry Kozia and Oakland Fight Club. A part of additional record labels, he has associated, collaborated and recorded with: Psy, VMF, Tupac Shakur, Teddy Riley, Felton Pilate, Tha Dogg Pound, The Whole 9, The Hines Brother, Deion Sanders, Big Daddy Kane, BeBe &amp; CeCe Winans and Jon Gibson. Hammer signed with Suge Knight's Death Row Records in 1995.</p><p>BET ranked Hammer as the No. 7 ""Best Dancer of All Time"". <i>Vibe</i><span>'</span>s ""The Best Rapper Ever Tournament"" declared him the 17th favorite of all-time during the first round. He continues to perform concerts at music venues and appears in television advertisements, along with participating in social media and ministry/outreach functions.

</p>
<p><b>Buena Vista Social Club</b> is an ensemble of Cuban musicians established in 1996. The project was organized by World Circuit executive Nick Gold, produced by American guitarist Ry Cooder and directed by Juan de Marcos González. They named the group after the homonymous members' club in the Buenavista quarter of Havana, a popular music venue in the 1940s. To showcase the popular styles of the time, such as son, bolero and danzón, they recruited a dozen veteran musicians, some of whom had been retired for many years.
</p><p>The group's eponymous album was recorded in March 1996 and released in September 1997, quickly becoming an international success, which prompted the ensemble to perform with a full line-up in Amsterdam and New York in 1998. German director Wim Wenders captured the performance on film for a documentary—also called <i>Buena Vista Social Club</i>—that included interviews with the musicians conducted in Havana. Wenders' film was released in June 1999 to critical acclaim, receiving an Academy Award nomination for Best Documentary feature and winning numerous accolades including Best Documentary at the European Film Awards. This was followed up by a second documentary <i>Buena Vista Social Club: Adios</i> in 2017.
</p><p>The success of both the album and film sparked a revival of interest in traditional Cuban music and Latin American music in general. Some of the Cuban performers later released well-received solo albums and recorded collaborations with stars from different musical genres. The ""Buena Vista Social Club"" name became an umbrella term to describe these performances and releases, and has been likened to a brand label that encapsulates Cuba's ""musical golden age"" between the 1930s and 1950s. The new success was fleeting for the most recognizable artists in the ensemble: Compay Segundo, Rubén González, and Ibrahim Ferrer, who died at the ages of ninety-five, eighty-four, and seventy-eight respectively; Compay Segundo and González in 2003, then Ferrer in 2005.
</p><p>Several surviving members of the Buena Vista Social Club, such as tresero Eliades Ochoa, veteran singer Omara Portuondo, trumpeter Manuel ""Guajiro"" Mirabal, laúd player Barbarito Torres and trombonist and conductor Jesús ""Aguaje"" Ramos currently tour worldwide, with new members such as singer Carlos Calunga and pianist Rolando Luna, as part of a 13-member band called <b>Orquesta Buena Vista Social Club</b>.</p>",

<p><b>Noah Benjamin Lennox</b> (born July 17, 1978), also known by his moniker <b>Panda Bear</b>, is an American musician, singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and co-founding member of the band Animal Collective. In addition to his work with that group, Lennox has released six solo LPs since 1999, with his influential 2007 album <i>Person Pitch</i> inspiring numerous subsequent acts. His subsequent albums <i>Tomboy</i> (2011) and <i>Panda Bear Meets the Grim Reaper</i> (2015) both reached the <i>Billboard</i> 200.
</p><p>Lennox was primarily raised in Baltimore, Maryland, where he sang tenor in his high school chamber choir, and studied piano and cello. The name ""Panda Bear"" derived from his habit of drawing pandas on his early mixtapes as a teenager. He and the other members of Animal Collective began collaborating in the late 1990s. He has also collaborated with other artists, including Daft Punk on their 2013 single ""Doin' It Right"" and Sonic Boom on the 2022 album <i>Reset</i>. Since 2004, he has lived in Lisbon, Portugal.
