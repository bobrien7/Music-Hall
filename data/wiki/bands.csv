</p>
<p><b>Coldplay</b> are a British rock band formed in London in 1997. They consist of vocalist and pianist Chris Martin, guitarist Jonny Buckland, bassist Guy Berryman, drummer Will Champion and creative director Phil Harvey. They met at University College London and began playing music together from 1996 to 1998, initially calling themselves Starfish.
</p><p>After independently releasing an extended play, <i>Safety</i> (1998), Coldplay signed with Parlophone in 1999. The band's debut album, <i>Parachutes</i> (2000), included their breakthrough single ""Yellow"" and received a Brit Award for British Album of the Year, a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album and a Mercury Prize nomination. Their second album, <i>A Rush of Blood to the Head</i> (2002), won the same accolades and included the single ""Clocks"", which won a Grammy Award for Record of the Year. The band's third album, <i>X&amp;Y</i> (2005), which completed what the band considered to be a trilogy, and their fourth album, <i>Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends</i> (2008), were both nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Album, with the latter winning; both albums were the best-selling of their respective years, topping the charts in over 30 countries. <i>Viva la Vida</i> was also nominated for Album of the Year, while its title track became the first single by a British group to simultaneously reach number one in the United Kingdom and United States in the 21st century.
</p><p>Coldplay further diversified their sound over their next five studio albums, the most recent being <i>Music of the Spheres</i> (2021). Each album presented a unique theme and added new musical styles to the band's original repertoire, including electronica, ambient, pop, R&amp;B, classical and progressive rock. They are also known for ""euphoric"" and ""immersive"" live performances, which <i>NME</i> said are when the band ""come alive and make the most sense"". In 2018, a career-spanning documentary directed by Mat Whitecross was released in select cinemas to mark the band's 20th anniversary.
</p><p>With 100 million albums sold worldwide, Coldplay are one of the best-selling music acts of all time. According to Fuse, they are the sixth-most awarded group in history, which includes the most Brit Award nominations and wins for a band. Other notable achievements include the seventh-highest-grossing tour of all time, three of the 50 highest-selling albums in the United Kingdom, the most number-one albums in the country without ever missing the top, and becoming the first British group to debut at number one on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. Coldplay are considered one of the most influential bands of the 21st century, with <i>Forbes</i> describing them as the standard for the current alternative music scene. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame included <i>A Rush of Blood to the Head</i> on their ""200 Definitive Albums"" list and the single ""Yellow"" is part of their ""Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll"" exhibition for being one of the most successful and important recordings in the music industry. Despite their popularity and impact, Coldplay have earned a reputation as polarizing music icons.

They have worked with the producer Nigel Godrich and the cover artist Stanley Donwood since 1994. Radiohead's experimental approach is credited with advancing the sound of alternative rock.
</p><p>Radiohead signed to EMI in 1991 and released their debut album, <i>Pablo Honey,</i> in 1993; their debut single, ""Creep"", became a worldwide hit. Radiohead's popularity and critical standing rose with the release of <i>The Bends</i> in 1995. Radiohead's third album, <i>OK Computer</i> (1997), brought them international fame; noted for its complex production and themes of modern alienation, it is acclaimed as a landmark record and one of the best albums in popular music.
</p><p>Radiohead's fourth album, <i>Kid A</i> (2000), marked a dramatic change in style, incorporating influences from electronic music, jazz, classical music and krautrock. Though <i>Kid A</i> divided listeners, it later attracted wide acclaim. It was followed by <i>Amnesiac</i> (2001), recorded in the same sessions. <i>Hail to the Thief</i> (2003), with lyrics addressing the War on Terror, blended the band's rock and electronic sides, and was Radiohead's final album for EMI.
</p><p>Radiohead self-released their seventh album, <i>In Rainbows</i> (2007), as a download for which customers could set their own price, to critical and chart success. Their eighth album, <i>The King of Limbs</i> (2011), an exploration of rhythm, was developed using extensive looping and sampling. <i>A Moon Shaped Pool</i> (2016) prominently featured Jonny Greenwood's orchestral arrangements. Yorke, Jonny Greenwood, Selway, and O'Brien have released solo albums; in 2021, Yorke and Jonny Greenwood debuted a new band, the Smile.
</p><p>By 2011, Radiohead had sold more than 30 million albums worldwide.

</p>
<p><b>Red Hot Chili Peppers</b> are an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1982, comprising vocalist Anthony Kiedis, bassist Flea, drummer Chad Smith, and guitarist John Frusciante. Their music incorporates elements of alternative rock, funk, punk rock, hard rock, hip hop, and psychedelic rock. Their eclectic range has influenced genres such as funk metal, rap metal, rap rock, and nu metal. With over 120 million records sold worldwide, Red Hot Chili Peppers are one of the best-selling bands of all time. They hold the records for most number-one singles (15), most cumulative weeks at number one (91) and most top-ten songs (28) on the <i>Billboard</i> Alternative Songs chart. They have won six Grammy Awards, were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012, and in 2022 received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
</p><p>Red Hot Chili Peppers were formed in Los Angeles by Kiedis, Flea, guitarist Hillel Slovak and drummer Jack Irons. Due to commitments to other bands, Slovak and Irons did not play on the band's 1984 self-titled debut album, which instead featured guitarist Jack Sherman and drummer Cliff Martinez. Slovak rejoined for their second album, <i>Freaky Styley</i> (1985), and Irons for their third, <i>The Uplift Mofo Party Plan</i> (1987). Irons left after Slovak died of a drug overdose in June 1988.
</p><p>With new recruits Frusciante and Smith, Red Hot Chili Peppers recorded <i>Mother's Milk</i> (1989) and their first major commercial success, <i>Blood Sugar Sex Magik</i> (1991). Frusciante was uncomfortable with their newfound popularity and left abruptly on tour in 1992. After a series of temporary guitarists, he was replaced by Dave Navarro, who appeared on the group's sixth album, <i>One Hot Minute</i> (1995). Although successful, the album failed to match the critical or popular acclaim of <i>Blood Sugar Sex Magik</i>. Frusciante and Kiedis struggled with drug addiction throughout the 1990s.
</p><p>In 1998, following Navarro's departure, Frusciante rejoined the band. Their seventh album, <i>Californication</i> (1999), became their biggest commercial success, with 16 million copies sold worldwide. <i>By the Way</i> (2002) and <i>Stadium Arcadium</i> (2006) were also successful; <i>Stadium Arcadium</i> was their first album to reach number one on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 chart. Frusciante left again in 2009 to focus on his solo career; he was replaced by Josh Klinghoffer, who appeared on <i>I'm with You</i> (2011) and <i>The Getaway</i> (2016), before Frusciante rejoined in 2019. They released their 12th and 13th albums, <i>Unlimited Love</i> and <i>Return of the Dream Canteen</i>, in 2022.</p>"

After going through a number of short-term bass players and drummers in their early days, both Mark Stoermer (bass, rhythm guitar, backing vocals) and Ronnie Vannucci Jr. (drums, percussion) joined the band in 2002. The band's name is derived from a logo on the bass drum of a fictitious band portrayed in the music video for the New Order song ""Crystal"".</p><p>The Killers have released seven studio albums, each of which reached the top spot on the UK Albums Chart: <i>Hot Fuss</i> (2004), <i>Sam's Town</i> (2006), <i>Day &amp; Age</i> (2008), <i>Battle Born</i> (2012), <i>Wonderful Wonderful</i> (2017), <i>Imploding the Mirage</i> (2020), and <i>Pressure Machine</i> (2021).

</p><p>Since 2016 and 2017 respectively, both Stoermer and Keuning have had extended periods of hiatus from the band, though both remain official members. Stoermer mostly retired from touring, citing both exhaustion from the road and lingering effects from a pyrotechnics accident, while Keuning has released a solo album. Despite his hiatus from touring, Stoermer has participated in recording sessions for <i>Wonderful Wonderful</i> and <i>Imploding the Mirage</i>, and it was announced that Keuning was participating in recording <i>Pressure Machine</i>, which was released on August 13, 2021. Ted Sablay, who had served as a touring keyboardist and rhythm guitarist for the band since 2006, assumed lead guitar duties for live shows in Keuning's absence, while touring rhythm guitarist and keyboardist Jake Blanton took up the job of bassist and has taken Stoermer's place in live shows. With Sablay moving to lead guitar, the band hired Taylor Milne and Robbie Connolly to play rhythm guitar and keyboards live.
</p><p>The Killers are considered one of the biggest rock bands of the 21st century, selling more than 28 million records worldwide, including 10.8 million in the US alone. They have performed in over 50 countries and on six continents, headlining venues such as Madison Square Garden, Wembley Stadium and Glastonbury Festival (2007 and 2019).

</p>
<p><b>Nirvana</b> was an American rock band formed in Aberdeen, Washington, in 1987. Founded by lead singer and guitarist Kurt Cobain and bassist Krist Novoselic, the band went through a succession of drummers, most notably Chad Channing, and then recruited Dave Grohl in 1990. Nirvana's success popularized alternative rock, and they were often referenced as the figurehead band of Generation X. Their music maintains a popular following and continues to influence modern rock culture.
</p><p>In the late 1980s, Nirvana established itself as part of the Seattle grunge scene, releasing its first album, <i>Bleach</i>, for the independent record label Sub Pop in 1989. They developed a sound that relied on dynamic contrasts, often between quiet verses and loud, heavy choruses. After signing to major label DGC Records in 1991, Nirvana found unexpected mainstream success with ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"", the first single from their landmark second album <i>Nevermind</i> (1991). A cultural phenomenon of the 1990s, <i>Nevermind</i> was certified Diamond by the RIAA and is credited for ending the dominance of hair metal.</p><p>Characterized by their punk aesthetic, Nirvana's fusion of pop melodies with noise, combined with their themes of abjection and social alienation, brought them global popularity. Following extensive tours and the 1992 compilation album <i>Incesticide</i> and EP <i>Hormoaning</i>, the band released their highly anticipated third studio album, <i>In Utero</i> (1993). The album topped both the US and UK album charts, and was acclaimed by critics. Nirvana disbanded following Cobain's suicide in April 1994. Various posthumous releases have been overseen by Novoselic, Grohl, and Cobain's widow Courtney Love. The posthumous live album <i>MTV Unplugged in New York</i> (1994) won Best Alternative Music Performance at the 1996 Grammy Awards.
</p><p>Nirvana is one of the best-selling bands of all time, having sold more than 75 million records worldwide. During their three years as a mainstream act, Nirvana received an American Music Award, Brit Award and Grammy Award, as well as seven MTV Video Music Awards and two NME Awards. They achieved five number-one hits on the <i>Billboard</i> Alternative Songs chart and four number-one albums on the <i>Billboard</i> 200. In 2004, <i>Rolling Stone</i> named Nirvana among the 100 greatest artists of all time. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in their first year of eligibility in 2014.

</p><p>Before forming Queen, May and Taylor had played together in the band Smile. Mercury was a fan of Smile and encouraged them to experiment with more elaborate stage and recording techniques. He joined in 1970 and suggested the name ""Queen"". Deacon was recruited in February 1971, before the band released their eponymous debut album in 1973. Queen first charted in the UK with their second album, <i>Queen II</i>, in 1974. <i>Sheer Heart Attack</i> later that year and <i>A Night at the Opera</i> in 1975 brought them international success. The latter featured ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", which stayed at number one in the UK for nine weeks and helped popularise the music video format.
</p><p>The band's 1977 album <i>News of the World</i> contained ""We Will Rock You"" and ""We Are the Champions"", which have become anthems at sporting events. By the early 1980s, Queen were one of the biggest stadium rock bands in the world. ""Another One Bites the Dust"" from <i>The Game</i> (1980) became their best-selling single, while their 1981 compilation album <i>Greatest Hits</i> is the best-selling album in the UK and is certified nine times platinum in the US. Their performance at the 1985 Live Aid concert is ranked among the greatest in rock history by various publications. In August 1986, Mercury gave his last performance with Queen at Knebworth, England. In 1991, he died of bronchopneumonia, a complication of AIDS. Deacon retired in 1997.

<p><b>Foo Fighters</b> is an American rock band formed in Seattle in 1994. Foo Fighters was initially formed as a one-man project by former Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl. Following the success of the 1995 eponymous debut album, Grohl (lead vocals, guitar) recruited a band consisting of Nate Mendel (bass guitar), William Goldsmith (drums), and Pat Smear (guitar). After a succession of lineup changes, including the departures of Goldsmith and Smear, the band formed its core lineup in 1999, consisting of Grohl, Mendel, Chris Shiflett (guitar), and Taylor Hawkins (drums). Smear rejoined in 2005, and Rami Jaffee (keys) joined in 2017.
</p><p>Prior to the release of the debut Foo Fighters album, Grohl recruited Mendel and Goldsmith, both formerly of Sunny Day Real Estate, and Smear, who had played with Nirvana on tour. The band began with performances in Portland, Oregon. Goldsmith quit during the recording of their second album, <i>The Colour and the Shape</i> (1997); most of the drum parts were re-recorded by Grohl. Smear departed soon afterward but appeared as a guest with the band frequently from 2005; he rejoined in 2010.
</p><p>Smear and Goldsmith were replaced by Franz Stahl and Taylor Hawkins; Stahl was fired before the recording of the group's third album, <i>There Is Nothing Left to Lose</i> (1999). The band briefly continued as a trio until Chris Shiflett joined on guitar after the completion of <i>There Is Nothing Left to Lose</i>.

The Rolling Stones,London,1962–present,The Rolling Stones,"<p class=""mw-empty-elt"">



</p>
<p><b>The Rolling Stones</b> are an English rock band formed in London in 1962. Active for six decades, they are one of the most popular and enduring bands of the rock era. In the early 1960s, the Rolling Stones pioneered the gritty, rhythmically driven sound that came to define hard rock. Their first stable line-up consisted of vocalist Mick Jagger, multi-instrumentalist Brian Jones, guitarist Keith Richards, bassist Bill Wyman, and drummer Charlie Watts. During their formative years, Jones was the primary leader: he assembled the band, named it, and drove their sound and image. After Andrew Loog Oldham became the group's manager in 1963, he encouraged them to write their own songs. Jagger and Richards became the primary creative force behind the band, alienating Jones, who had developed a drug addiction that interfered with his ability to contribute meaningfully.
</p><p>Rooted in blues and early rock and roll, the Rolling Stones started out playing covers and were at the forefront of the British Invasion in 1964, becoming identified with the youthful and rebellious counterculture of the 1960s. They then found greater success with their own material, as ""(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction"" (1965), ""Get Off of My Cloud"" (1965), and ""Paint It Black"" (1966) became international number-one hits. <i>Aftermath</i> (1966) – their first entirely original album – is considered by <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> to be the most important of their formative records. In 1967, they had the double-sided hit ""Ruby Tuesday""/""Let's Spend the Night Together"" and experimented with psychedelic rock on <i>Their Satanic Majesties Request</i>. They returned to their rhythm and blues roots with hit songs such as ""Jumpin' Jack Flash"" (1968) and ""Honky Tonk Women"" (1969), and albums such as <i>Beggars Banquet</i> (1968), featuring ""Sympathy for the Devil"", and <i>Let It Bleed</i> (1969), featuring ""You Can't Always Get What You Want"" and ""Gimme Shelter"". <i>Let It Bleed</i> was the first of five consecutive number-one albums in the UK.
</p><p>Jones left the band shortly before his death in 1969, having been replaced by guitarist Mick Taylor. That year they were first introduced on stage as ""The Greatest Rock and Roll Band in the World"". <i>Sticky Fingers</i> (1971), which yielded ""Brown Sugar"" and included the first usage of their tongue and lips logo, was their first of eight consecutive number-one studio albums in the US. <i>Exile on Main St.</i> (1972), featuring ""Tumbling Dice"", and <i>Goats Head Soup</i> (1973), yielding the hit ballad ""Angie"", were also best sellers. Taylor was replaced by Ronnie Wood in 1974. The band continued to release successful albums, including their two largest sellers: <i>Some Girls</i> (1978), featuring ""Miss You"", and <i>Tattoo You</i> (1981), featuring ""Start Me Up"". <i>Steel Wheels</i> (1989) was widely considered a comeback album and was followed by <i>Voodoo Lounge</i> (1994), a worldwide number-one album. Both releases were promoted by large stadium and arena tours, as the Stones continued to be a huge concert attraction; by 2007 they had recorded the all-time highest-grossing concert tour three times, and as recently as 2021 they were the highest-earning live act of the year. From Wyman's departure in 1993 to Watts' death in 2021, the band continued as a four-piece core, with Darryl Jones playing bass on tour and on most studio recordings, while Steve Jordan became their touring drummer following Watts' death. Their 2016 album, <i>Blue &amp; Lonesome</i>, became their twelfth UK number-one album.
</p><p>The Rolling Stones' estimated record sales of 200 million make them one of the best-selling music artists of all time. The band has won three Grammy Awards and a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2004. <i>Billboard</i> magazine and <i>Rolling Stone</i> have ranked the band as one of the greatest of all time.

</p>
<p><b>Daft Punk</b> were a French electronic music duo formed in 1993 in Paris by Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo. They achieved popularity in the late 1990s as part of the French house movement, combining elements of house music with funk, disco, rock and pop. They garnered acclaim and commercial success and are regarded as one of the most influential acts in dance music.
</p><p>Bangalter and Homem-Christo formed Daft Punk after their indie rock band Darlin' disbanded and began experimenting with drum machines and synthesisers. Their debut studio album, <i>Homework</i>, was released by Virgin Records in 1997 to positive reviews, backed by the singles ""Around the World"" and ""Da Funk"". From 1999, Daft Punk assumed robot personas for public appearances, with helmets, outfits and gloves to disguise their identities; they made few media appearances. They were managed from 1996 to 2008 by Pedro Winter, the head of Ed Banger Records.

</p>
<p><b>Green Day</b> is an American rock band formed in the East Bay of California in 1987 by lead vocalist and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong, together with bassist and backing vocalist Mike Dirnt. For most of the band's career, they have been a power trio with drummer Tré Cool, who replaced John Kiffmeyer in 1990 before the recording of the band's second studio album, <i>Kerplunk</i> (1991). Touring guitarist Jason White became a full-time member in 2012, but returned to his touring role in 2016. Before taking its current name in 1989, Green Day was called <b>Sweet Children</b>, and they were part of the late 1980s/early 1990s Bay Area punk scene that emerged from the 924 Gilman Street club in Berkeley, California. The band's early releases were with the independent record label Lookout! Records. In 1994, their major-label debut <i>Dookie</i>, released through Reprise Records, became a breakout success and eventually shipped over 10 million copies in the U.S. Alongside fellow California punk bands Bad Religion, the Offspring, Rancid, NOFX, Pennywise and Social Distortion, Green Day is credited with popularizing mainstream interest in punk rock in the U.S.
</p><p>Though the albums <i>Insomniac</i> (1995), <i>Nimrod</i> (1997), and <i>Warning</i> (2000) did not match the success of <i>Dookie</i>, they were still successful, with the former two reaching double platinum status, while the latter achieved gold. Green Day's seventh album, a rock opera called <i>American Idiot</i> (2004), found popularity with a younger generation, selling six million copies in the U.S. Their next album, <i>21st Century Breakdown</i>, was released in 2009 and achieved the band's best chart performance. It was followed by a trilogy of albums, <i>¡Uno!</i>, <i>¡Dos!</i>, and <i>¡Tré!</i>, released in September, November, and December 2012, respectively. The trilogy did not perform as well as expected commercially, in comparison to their previous albums, largely due to lack of promotion and Armstrong entering rehab. Their twelfth studio album, <i>Revolution Radio</i>, was released in October 2016 and became their third to debut at No. 1 on the <i> Billboard</i> 200. The band's thirteenth studio album, <i>Father of All Motherfuckers</i>, was released on February 7, 2020.
</p><p>In 2010, a stage adaptation of <i>American Idiot</i> debuted on Broadway. The musical was nominated for three Tony Awards: Best Musical, Best Scenic Design, and Best Lighting Design, winning the latter two. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2015, their first year of eligibility. Members of the band have collaborated on the side projects Pinhead Gunpowder, the Network, Foxboro Hot Tubs, the Longshot, and the Coverups. They have also worked on solo careers.
</p><p>Green Day has sold more than 75 million records worldwide, making them one of the world's best-selling artists. The group has been nominated for 20 Grammy awards and has won five of them with Best Alternative Album for <i>Dookie</i>, Best Rock Album for <i>American Idiot</i> and <i>21st Century Breakdown</i>, Record of the Year for ""Boulevard of Broken Dreams"", and Best Musical Show Album for <i>American Idiot: The Original Broadway Cast Recording</i>.

</p>
<p><b>The Beatles</b> were an English rock band, formed in Liverpool in 1960, that comprised John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr. They are regarded as the most influential band of all time and were integral to the development of 1960s counterculture and popular music's recognition as an art form. Rooted in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock 'n' roll, their sound incorporated elements of classical music and traditional pop in innovative ways; the band also explored music styles ranging from folk and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock. As pioneers in recording, songwriting and artistic presentation, the Beatles revolutionised many aspects of the music industry and were often publicised as leaders of the era's youth and sociocultural movements.</p><p>Led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, the Beatles evolved from Lennon's previous group, the Quarrymen, and built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over three years from 1960, initially with Stuart Sutcliffe playing bass. The core trio of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, together since 1958, went through a succession of drummers, including Pete Best, before asking Starr to join them in 1962. Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act, and producer George Martin guided and developed their recordings, greatly expanding their domestic success after signing to EMI Records and achieving their first hit, ""Love Me Do"", in late 1962. As their popularity grew into the intense fan frenzy dubbed ""Beatlemania"", the band acquired the nickname ""the Fab Four"", with Epstein, Martin or another member of the band's entourage sometimes informally referred to as a ""fifth Beatle"".
</p><p>By early 1964, the Beatles were international stars and had achieved unprecedented levels of critical and commercial success. They became a leading force in Britain's cultural resurgence, ushering in the British Invasion of the United States pop market, and soon made their film debut with <i>A Hard Day's Night</i> (1964). A growing desire to refine their studio efforts, coupled with the untenable nature of their concert tours, led to the band's retirement from live performances in 1966. At this time, they produced records of greater sophistication, including the albums <i>Rubber Soul</i> (1965), <i>Revolver</i> (1966) and <i>Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</i> (1967), and enjoyed further commercial success with <i>The Beatles</i> (also known as ""the White Album"", 1968) and <i>Abbey Road</i> (1969). The success of these records heralded the album era, as albums became the dominant form of record consumption over singles; they also increased public interest in psychedelic drugs and Eastern spirituality, and furthered advancements in electronic music, album art and music videos. In 1968, they founded Apple Corps, a multi-armed multimedia corporation that continues to oversee projects related to the band's legacy. After the group's break-up in 1970, all principal former members enjoyed success as solo artists and some partial reunions have occurred. Lennon was murdered in 1980 and Harrison died of lung cancer in 2001. McCartney and Starr remain musically active.
</p><p>The Beatles are the best-selling music act of all time, with estimated sales of 600 million units worldwide. They hold the record for most number-one albums on the UK Albums Chart (15), most number-one hits on the US <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 chart (20), and most singles sold in the UK (21.9 million). The band received many accolades, including seven Grammy Awards, four Brit Awards, an Academy Award (for Best Original Song Score for the 1970 documentary film <i>Let It Be</i>) and fifteen Ivor Novello Awards. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988, and each principal member was inducted individually between 1994 and 2015. In 2004 and 2011, the group topped <i>Rolling Stone</i><span>'</span>s lists of the greatest artists in history. <i>Time</i> magazine named them among the 20th century's 100 most important people.

<p><b>Oasis</b> were an English rock band formed in Manchester in 1991. Originally known as the Rain, the group initially consisted of Liam Gallagher (lead vocals, tambourine), Paul Arthurs (guitar), Paul McGuigan (bass guitar) and Tony McCarroll (drums). Liam's older brother Noel (lead guitar, vocals) later joined as a fifth member, finalising the group's core lineup. During the course of their existence, they had various lineup changes, with the Gallagher brothers remaining the only staple members. 
</p><p>Oasis signed to independent record label Creation Records in 1993 and released their record-setting debut album <i>Definitely Maybe</i> (1994). The following year they recorded <i>(What's the Story) Morning Glory?</i> (1995) with drummer Alan White, in the midst of a chart rivalry with peers Blur. Spending ten weeks at number one on the UK Albums Chart, <i>(What's the Story) Morning Glory?</i> was also an international chart success and became one of the best-selling albums of all time. In addition, it stands as the fifth-best-selling album in the UK and the biggest-selling album in the UK of the 1990s. The Gallagher brothers featured regularly in tabloid newspapers for their disputes and wild lifestyles. In 1996, Oasis performed two nights at Knebworth for an audience of 125,000 each time, the largest outdoor concerts in UK history at the time. In 1997, Oasis released their third album, <i>Be Here Now</i>. It became the fastest-selling album in UK chart history.
</p><p>Oasis' popularity later declined and McGuigan and Arthurs left in 1999 as Oasis released <i>Standing on the Shoulder of Giants</i> (2000). They were replaced by former Heavy Stereo guitarist Gem Archer and former Ride guitarist Andy Bell. White departed in 2004, replaced by Zak Starkey and later Chris Sharrock as touring members. Oasis released three more studio albums, <i>Heathen Chemistry</i> (2002), <i>Don't Believe the Truth</i> (2005) and <i>Dig Out Your Soul</i> (2008). The group abruptly disbanded after the departure of Noel Gallagher in August 2009.
</p><p>As of 2009, Oasis had sold over 70 million records worldwide.

</p><p>After self-releasing their independent album <i>We Like Digging?</i>, the band signed to Reprise Records and released the album <i>The Fourth World</i> in 1997.

<p><b>U2</b> are an Irish rock band from Dublin, formed in 1976. The group consists of Bono (lead vocals and rhythm guitar), the Edge (lead guitar, keyboards, and backing vocals), Adam Clayton (bass guitar), and Larry Mullen Jr. (drums and percussion). Initially rooted in post-punk, U2's musical style has evolved throughout their career, yet has maintained an anthemic quality built on Bono's expressive vocals and the Edge's chiming, effects-based guitar sounds. Bono's lyrics, often embellished with spiritual imagery, focus on personal and sociopolitical themes. Popular for their live performances, the group have staged several ambitious and elaborate tours over their career.
</p><p>The band was formed when the members were teenaged pupils of Mount Temple Comprehensive School and had limited musical proficiency. Within four years, they signed with Island Records and released their debut album, <i>Boy</i> (1980). Works such as their first UK number-one album, <i>War</i> (1983), and the singles ""Sunday Bloody Sunday"" and ""Pride (In the Name of Love)"" helped establish U2's reputation as a politically and socially conscious group. By the mid-1980s, they had become renowned globally for their live act, highlighted by their performance at Live Aid in 1985. U2's fifth album, <i>The Joshua Tree</i> (1987), made them international stars and was their greatest critical and commercial success. Topping music charts around the world, it produced their only number-one singles in the US to date: ""With or Without You"" and ""I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For"".
</p><p>Facing creative stagnation and a backlash to their documentary/double album, <i>Rattle and Hum</i> (1988), U2 reinvented themselves in the 1990s. Beginning with their acclaimed seventh album, <i>Achtung Baby</i> (1991), and the multimedia-intensive Zoo TV Tour, the band pursued a new musical direction influenced by alternative rock, electronic dance music, and industrial music, and they embraced a more ironic, flippant image. This experimentation continued through their ninth album, <i>Pop</i> (1997), and the PopMart Tour, which were mixed successes. U2 regained critical and commercial favour with the records <i>All That You Can't Leave Behind</i> (2000) and <i>How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb</i> (2004), which established a more conventional, mainstream sound for the group. Their U2 360° Tour of 2009–2011 set records for the highest-attended and highest-grossing concert tour, both of which were surpassed in 2019. The group most recently released the companion albums <i>Songs of Innocence</i> (2014) and <i>Songs of Experience</i> (2017), the former of which received criticism for its pervasive, no-cost release through the iTunes Store.
</p><p>U2 have released 14 studio albums and are one of the world's best-selling music artists, having sold an estimated 150–170 million records worldwide. They have won 22 Grammy Awards, more than any other band, and in 2005, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in their first year of eligibility. <i>Rolling Stone</i> ranked U2 at number 22 on its list of the ""100 Greatest Artists of All Time"".

Formed in 1998, the band is composed of lead singer and songwriter Julian Casablancas, guitarists Nick Valensi and Albert Hammond Jr., bassist Nikolai Fraiture, and drummer Fabrizio Moretti. They were a leading group of the early-2000s indie rock revival.
</p><p>The release of their EP <i>The Modern Age</i> in early 2001 sparked a bidding war among major labels, with the band eventually signing to RCA Records. That summer, they released their debut album, <i>Is This It</i>, to critical acclaim and strong sales. It has since appeared on numerous ""best album"" lists. It was followed by <i>Room on Fire</i> (2003) and <i>First Impressions of Earth</i> (2005), both of which sold well but failed to match <i>Is This It</i> in critical success.
</p><p>Following a five-year hiatus, they released <i>Angles</i> (2011) to a generally positive reception, and <i>Comedown Machine</i> (2013) to lukewarm critical reception, both with dwindling sales. Following the end of their initial contract with RCA, they released the <i>Future Present Past</i> EP (2016) through Casablancas' label Cult. The band were relatively inactive throughout the decade, making infrequent live appearances and directing most media attention to individual projects.
</p><p>In 2020, they released their first studio album in seven years, <i>The New Abnormal</i>, produced by Rick Rubin and released through Cult and RCA. Critics considered the album a return to form. It went on to win Best Rock Album at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards.</p>"

</p>
<p><b>Guns N' Roses</b> is an American hard rock band from Los Angeles, California, formed in 1985. When they signed to Geffen Records in 1986, the band comprised vocalist Axl Rose, lead guitarist Slash, rhythm guitarist Izzy Stradlin, bassist Duff McKagan, and drummer Steven Adler. The current lineup consists of Rose, Slash, McKagan, guitarist Richard Fortus, drummer Frank Ferrer and keyboardists Dizzy Reed and Melissa Reese.
</p><p>Guns N' Roses' debut album, <i>Appetite for Destruction</i> (1987), reached number one on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 a year after its release, on the strength of the top 10 singles ""Welcome to the Jungle"", ""Paradise City"", and ""Sweet Child o' Mine"", the band's only single to reach number one on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. The album has sold approximately 30 million copies worldwide, including 18 million units in the United States, making it the country's bestselling debut album and eleventh-bestselling album. Their next studio album, <i>G N' R Lies</i> (1988), reached number two on the <i>Billboard</i> 200, sold ten million copies worldwide (including five million in the U.S.), and included the top 5 hit ""Patience"". <i>Use Your Illusion I</i> and <i>Use Your Illusion II</i>, recorded simultaneously and released in 1991, debuted at number two and number one on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 respectively and have sold a combined 35 million copies worldwide (including 14 million units in the U.S.). The <i>Illusion</i> albums included the lead single ""You Could Be Mine"", covers of ""Live and Let Die"" and ""Knockin' on Heaven's Door"", and a trilogy of ballads (""Don't Cry"", ""November Rain"", and ""Estranged""), which featured notably high-budget music videos. The records were supported by the Use Your Illusion Tour, a world tour that lasted from 1991 to 1993. The covers album <i>""The Spaghetti Incident?""</i> (1993) was the last studio album to feature Slash and McKagan before their initial departure.
</p><p>Work on a follow-up album stalled due to creative differences between band members; by 1998 only Rose and Reed remained from the <i>Illusion</i>-era lineup. Rose, wanting to expand the band's sound with industrial and electronic elements, enrolled an eclectic lineup of musicians, including punk bassist Tommy Stinson, virtuoso guitarist Buckethead, synth player Chris Pitman and several touring members of Nine Inch Nails, among others. After a decade of work, Guns N' Roses's long-awaited sixth studio album, <i>Chinese Democracy</i> (2008), was released, featuring the title track as lead single. At an estimated $14 million in production costs, it is the most expensive rock album in history. It debuted at number three on the <i>Billboard</i> 200, but undersold industry expectations despite a mostly positive critical reception. Following the expansive Chinese Democracy Tour, Slash and McKagan rejoined the band in 2016 for the Not in This Lifetime... Tour, which became the third-highest-grossing concert tour on record, grossing over $584 million by its conclusion in 2019.
</p><p>In their early years, the band's hedonism and rebelliousness drew comparisons to the early Rolling Stones and earned them the nickname ""the most dangerous band in the world"". The band's classic lineup, along with later members Reed and drummer Matt Sorum, was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012, its first year of eligibility. Guns N' Roses have sold more than 100 million records worldwide, including 45 million in the United States, making them one of the best-selling acts in history.

</p>
<p><b>The Doors</b> were an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1965, with vocalist Jim Morrison, keyboardist Ray Manzarek, guitarist Robby Krieger, and drummer John Densmore. They were among the most influential and controversial rock acts of the 1960s, partly due to Morrison's lyrics and voice, along with his erratic stage persona. The group is widely regarded as an important figure of the era's counterculture.</p><p>The band took its name from the title of Aldous Huxley's book <i>The Doors of Perception</i>, itself a reference to a quote by William Blake. After signing with Elektra Records in 1966, the Doors with Morrison recorded and released six studio albums in five years, some of which are generally considered among the greatest of all time, including their self-titled debut (1967), <i>Strange Days</i> (1967), and <i>L.A. Woman</i> (1971). They were one of the most successful bands during that time and by 1972 the Doors had sold over 4 million albums domestically and nearly 8 million singles.</p><p>Morrison died in uncertain circumstances in 1971. The band continued as a trio until disbanding in 1973. They released three more albums in the 1970s, one of which featured earlier recordings by Morrison, and over the decades reunited on stage in various configurations. In 2002, Manzarek, Krieger, and Ian Astbury of the Cult on vocals started performing as ""The Doors of the 21st Century"". Densmore and the Morrison estate successfully sued them over the use of the band's name. After a short time as Riders on the Storm, they settled on the name Manzarek–Krieger and toured until Manzarek's death in 2013.
</p><p>The Doors were the first American band to accumulate eight consecutive gold LPs. According to the RIAA, they have sold 34 million albums in the United States and over 100 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling bands of all time. The Doors have been listed as one of the greatest artists of all time by magazines including <i>Rolling Stone</i>, which ranked them 41st on its list of the ""100 Greatest Artists of All Time"". In 1993, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

<p><b>Pink Floyd</b> are an English rock band formed in London in 1965. Gaining an early following as one of the first British psychedelic groups, they were distinguished by their extended compositions, sonic experimentation, philosophical lyrics and elaborate live shows. They became a leading band of the progressive rock genre, cited by some as the greatest progressive rock band of all time.
</p><p>Pink Floyd were founded in 1965 by Syd Barrett (guitar, lead vocals), Nick Mason (drums), Roger Waters (bass guitar, vocals), and Richard Wright (keyboards, vocals). Under Barrett's leadership, they released two charting singles and the successful debut album <i>The Piper at the Gates of Dawn</i> (1967). The guitarist and vocalist David Gilmour joined in December 1967; Barrett left in April 1968 due to deteriorating mental health. Waters became the primary lyricist and thematic leader, devising the concepts behind Pink Floyd's most successful albums, <i>The Dark Side of the Moon</i> (1973), <i>Wish You Were Here</i> (1975), <i>Animals</i> (1977) and <i>The Wall</i> (1979). The musical film based on <i>The Wall</i>, <i>Pink Floyd – The Wall</i> (1982), won two BAFTA Awards. Pink Floyd also composed several film scores. 
</p><p>Following personal tensions, Wright left Pink Floyd in 1979, followed by Waters in 1985. Gilmour and Mason continued as Pink Floyd, rejoined later by Wright. They produced the albums <i>A Momentary Lapse of Reason</i> (1987) and <i>The Division Bell</i> (1994), backed by major tours, before entering a long hiatus. In 2005, all but Barrett reunited for a performance at the global awareness event Live 8. Barrett died in 2006, and Wright in 2008. The last Pink Floyd studio album, <i>The Endless River</i> (2014), was based on unreleased material from the <i>Division Bell</i> recording sessions. In 2022, Gilmour and Mason reformed Pink Floyd to release the song ""Hey, Hey, Rise Up!"" in protest of the Russo-Ukrainian War.
</p><p>By 2013, Pink Floyd had sold more than 250 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling music artists of all time. <i>The Dark Side of the Moon</i> and <i>The Wall</i> were inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, and these albums and <i>Wish You Were Here</i> are among the best-selling albums of all time. Four Pink Floyd albums topped the US Billboard 200, and five topped the UK Albums Chart.

Backed by music videos for the singles ""Buddy Holly"", ""Undone – The Sweater Song"", and ""Say It Ain't So"", the Blue Album became a multiplatinum success. Weezer's second album, <i>Pinkerton</i> (1996), featuring a darker, more abrasive sound, was a commercial failure and initially received mixed reviews, but achieved cult status and critical acclaim years later. Both the Blue Album and <i>Pinkerton</i> are now frequently cited among the best albums of the 1990s. Following the tour for <i>Pinkerton</i>, founding bassist Matt Sharp left the band and Weezer went on hiatus.

Their current lineup consists of bassist/vocalist Mark Hoppus, guitarist/vocalist Tom DeLonge, and drummer Travis Barker. Though their sound has diversified throughout their career, their musical style, described as pop-punk, blends catchy pop melodies with fast-paced punk rock. Their lyrics center on relationships, adolescent frustration, and maturity—or lack thereof. The group emerged from a suburban, Southern California skate-punk scene and gained notoriety for high-energy live shows and irreverent humor.
</p><p>After years of independent recording and touring, including stints on the Warped Tour, the group signed to MCA Records. Their biggest albums, <i>Enema of the State</i> (1999) and <i>Take Off Your Pants and Jacket</i> (2001), saw international success. Songs like ""All the Small Things"", ""Dammit"", ""I Miss You"", and ""What's My Age Again?"" became hit singles and MTV staples. Later efforts, including an untitled album (2003), marked stylistic shifts. Hoppus is the only member to remain in the band throughout its entire history. DeLonge left the group twice, both times a decade apart, before eventually returning. Founding drummer Scott Raynor recorded and toured with the group before being dismissed in 1998, with Barker taking his place from that point on.

The group consisted of Jack White (songwriter, vocals, guitar, piano, and mandolin) and Meg White (drums and vocals). After releasing several singles and three albums within the Detroit music scene, the White Stripes rose to prominence in 2002 as part of the garage rock revival scene. Their successful and critically acclaimed albums <i>White Blood Cells</i> and <i>Elephant</i> drew attention from a large variety of media outlets in the United States and the United Kingdom. The single ""Seven Nation Army"", which used a guitar and an octave pedal to create the opening riff, became one of their most recognizable songs. The band recorded two more albums, <i>Get Behind Me Satan</i> in 2005 and <i>Icky Thump</i> in 2007, and dissolved in 2011 after a lengthy hiatus from performing and recording.</p><p>The White Stripes used a low-fidelity approach to writing and recording. Their music featured a melding of garage rock and blues influences and a raw simplicity of composition, arrangement, and performance. The duo were also noted for their fashion and design aesthetic which featured a simple color scheme of red, white, and black—which was used on every album and single cover the band released—as well as the band's fascination with the number three. The band's discography consists of six studio albums, two live albums, one extended play (EP), one concert film, one tour documentary, 26 singles, and 14 music videos.

<p><b>The Cure</b> are an English rock band formed in 1978 in Crawley, West Sussex. Throughout numerous lineup changes since the band's formation, guitarist, lead vocalist, and songwriter Robert Smith has remained the only constant member. The band's debut album, <i>Three Imaginary Boys</i> (1979), along with several early singles, placed the band in the post-punk and new wave movements that had sprung up in the United Kingdom. Beginning with their second album, <i>Seventeen Seconds</i> (1980), the band adopted a new, increasingly dark and tormented style, which, together with Smith's stage look, had a strong influence on the emerging genre of gothic rock as well as the subculture that eventually formed around the genre.
</p><p>After the release of the band's fourth album, <i>Pornography</i> (1982), Smith introduced a greater pop sensibility into the band's music, and they subsequently garnered worldwide mainstream success. Their singles compilation <i>Standing on a Beach</i> (1986) sold four million copies worldwide by 1989, and they reached their commercial peak with the albums <i>Disintegration</i> (1989) and <i>Wish</i> (1992).

<p><b>Led Zeppelin</b> were  an English rock band formed in London in 1968. The group comprised vocalist Robert Plant, guitarist Jimmy Page, bassist/keyboardist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. With a heavy, guitar-driven sound, they are cited as one of the progenitors of hard rock and heavy metal, although their style drew from a variety of influences, including blues and folk music. Led Zeppelin have been credited as significantly impacting the nature of the music industry, particularly in the development of album-oriented rock (AOR) and stadium rock.
</p><p>Originally named the New Yardbirds, Led Zeppelin signed a deal with Atlantic Records that gave them considerable artistic freedom. Initially unpopular with critics, they achieved significant commercial success with eight studio albums over ten years. Their 1969 debut, <i>Led Zeppelin</i>, was a top-ten album in several countries and featured such tracks as ""Good Times Bad Times"", ""Dazed and Confused"" and ""Communication Breakdown"". <i>Led Zeppelin II</i> (1969) was their first number-one album, and yielded ""Ramble On"" and ""Whole Lotta Love"". In 1970, they released <i>Led Zeppelin III</i> which featured ""Immigrant Song"". Their untitled fourth album, commonly known as <i>Led Zeppelin IV</i> (1971), is one of the best-selling albums in history with 37 million copies sold. The album includes ""Black Dog"", ""Rock and Roll"" and ""Stairway to Heaven"", with the latter being among the most popular and influential works in rock history. <i>Houses of the Holy</i> (1973) yielded ""The Ocean"", ""Over the Hills and Far Away"" and ""The Rain Song"". <i>Physical Graffiti</i> (1975), a double album, featured ""Trampled Under Foot"" and ""Kashmir"".
</p><p>Page wrote most of Led Zeppelin's music, particularly early in their career, while Plant wrote most of the lyrics. Jones's keyboard-based compositions later became central to their music, which featured increasing experimentation. The latter half of their career saw a series of record-breaking tours that earned the group a reputation for excess and debauchery. Although they remained commercially and critically successful, their touring and output, which included <i>Presence</i> (1976) and <i>In Through the Out Door</i> (1979), grew limited, and the group disbanded following Bonham's death in 1980. Since then, the surviving former members have sporadically collaborated and participated in one-off reunions. The most successful of these was the 2007 Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert in London, with Bonham's son Jason Bonham on drums.
</p><p>Led Zeppelin are one of the best-selling music artists of all time; their total record sales are estimated to be between 200 and 300 million units worldwide. They achieved eight consecutive UK number-one albums and six number-one albums on the US <i>Billboard</i> 200, with five of their albums certified Diamond in the US. <i>Rolling Stone</i> magazine described them as ""the heaviest band of all time"", ""the biggest band of the Seventies"", and ""unquestionably one of the most enduring bands in rock history"". They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995; the museum's biography of the band states that they were ""as influential"" during the 1970s as the Beatles were during the 1960s.</p>"

<p><b>Aerosmith</b> is an American rock band formed in Boston in 1970. The group consists of Steven Tyler (lead vocals, harmonica, piano), Joe Perry (guitar), Tom Hamilton (bass), Joey Kramer (drums) and Brad Whitford (guitar). Their style, which is rooted in blues-based hard rock, has also incorporated elements of pop rock, heavy metal, glam metal, and rhythm and blues, and has inspired many subsequent rock artists. They are sometimes referred to as ""the Bad Boys from Boston"" and ""America's Greatest Rock and Roll Band"". The primary songwriting team of Tyler and Perry is often known as the ""Toxic Twins"".
</p><p>Perry and Hamilton, originally in a band together called the Jam Band, met up with Tyler, Kramer, and guitarist Ray Tabano, and formed Aerosmith; in 1971, Tabano was replaced by Whitford. They released a string of multi-platinum albums starting with their eponymous debut in 1973, followed by <i>Get Your Wings</i> in 1974. The band broke into the mainstream with <i>Toys in the Attic</i> (1975) and <i>Rocks</i> (1976). <i>Draw the Line</i> and <i>Night in the Ruts</i> followed in 1977 and 1979. Throughout the 1970s, the band toured extensively and charted a dozen Hot 100 singles, including their first Top 40 hit ""Sweet Emotion"" and the Top 10 hits ""Dream On"" and ""Walk This Way"". By the end of the decade, they were among the most popular hard rock bands in the world and developed a following of fans, often referred to as the ""Blue Army"". Drug addiction and internal conflict led to the departures of Perry and Whitford in 1979 and 1981.
The band did not fare well and the album <i>Rock in a Hard Place</i> (1982) failed to match previous successes.
</p><p>Perry and Whitford returned to Aerosmith in 1984. After a comeback tour, they recorded <i>Done with Mirrors</i> (1985), which did not meet commercial expectations. It was not until a 1986 collaboration with rap group Run–D.M.C. on a remake of ""Walk This Way"", and the 1987 multi-platinum release, <i>Permanent Vacation</i>, that they regained their previous level of popularity. In the late 1980s and 1990s, the band won numerous awards for music from the multi-platinum albums <i>Pump</i> (1989), <i>Get a Grip</i> (1993), and <i>Nine Lives</i> (1997), while they embarked on their most extensive concert tours to date. Their biggest hits during this period included ""Dude (Looks Like a Lady)"", ""Angel"", ""Rag Doll"", ""Love in an Elevator"", ""Janie's Got a Gun"", ""What it Takes"", ""Livin' on the Edge"", ""Cryin'"", and ""Crazy"". The band also filmed popular music videos and made notable appearances in television, film, and video games. In 1998, they achieved their first number-one hit with ""I Don't Want to Miss a Thing"" from <i>Armageddon'</i>s soundtrack and the following year, their roller coaster attraction opened at Walt Disney World. Their comeback has been described as one of the most remarkable and spectacular in rock history. Additional albums <i>Just Push Play</i> (which included the hit ""Jaded""), <i>Honkin' on Bobo</i> (a collection of blues covers), and <i>Music from Another Dimension!</i> followed in 2001, 2004, and 2012. In 2008, they released <i>Guitar Hero: Aerosmith</i>, which is considered to be the best-selling band-centric video game. After five decades, the band continues to tour and record music. From 2019–2022, the band had a concert residency in Las Vegas, which was interrupted from 2020–2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
</p><p>Aerosmith is the best-selling American hard rock band of all time, having sold more than 150 million records worldwide, including over 85 million records in the United States.

The Offspring,Garden Grove,1984–present,The Offspring,"<p class=""mw-empty-elt"">
</p>
<p><b>The Offspring</b> is an American rock band from Garden Grove, California, formed in 1984. Originally formed under the name <b>Manic Subsidal</b>, the band's current lineup consists of lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Bryan ""Dexter"" Holland, lead guitarist Kevin ""Noodles"" Wasserman and bassist Todd Morse. Over the course of their <span></span>39-year career, the Offspring has released ten studio albums and have also experienced a number of lineup changes, most notably with their drummer. Their longest-serving drummer was Ron Welty, who replaced original drummer James Lilja in 1987 and stayed with the Offspring for 16 years. Welty was replaced by Atom Willard in 2003, who was replaced four years later by Pete Parada, who remained as the drummer for the Offspring until he was fired from the band in 2021 for refusing to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Gregory ""Greg K."" Kriesel (one of the Offspring's cofounders) was their bassist until 2018, when he was fired from the band due to business disputes, thus leaving Holland as the sole remaining original member. Kriesel was replaced by Todd Morse of H<sub>2</sub>O, who had been the Offspring's touring guitarist since 2009.</p><p>The Offspring is often credited—alongside fellow California punk bands Green Day, NOFX, Bad Religion and Rancid—for reviving mainstream interest in punk rock in the 1990s. They have sold over 40 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling punk rock bands in history.</p><p>After achieving a local following with their early releases, including their 1989 self-titled debut album and the vinyl-only EP <i>Baghdad</i> (1991), the Offspring signed with independent label Epitaph Records and released two albums: <i>Ignition</i> (1992) and <i>Smash</i> (1994). <i>Smash</i>, which contained the band's first major hit ""Come Out and Play"", propelled punk rock into the mainstream and holds the distinction as one of the best-selling albums released on an independent record label, selling over 11 million copies worldwide. The success of <i>Smash</i> attracted attention from major labels including Columbia Records, with whom The Offspring signed in 1996; their first album for the label, <i>Ixnay on the Hombre</i> (1997), did not match its predecessor’s success, but received favorable reviews and gold and platinum RIAA certifications. The band's fifth album <i>Americana</i> (1998) regained their previous level of popularity, obtaining support from MTV and radio and selling over five million units in the US. The Offspring has since released five more albums: <i>Conspiracy of One</i> (2000); <i>Splinter</i> (2003); <i>Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace</i> (2008); <i>Days Go By</i> (2012); and <i>Let the Bad Times Roll</i> (2021).

Metallica,,1981–present,Metallica,"<p class=""mw-empty-elt"">



</p>
<p><b>Metallica</b> is an American heavy metal band. The band was formed in 1981 in Los Angeles by vocalist/guitarist James Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich, and has been based in San Francisco for most of its career. The band's fast tempos, instrumentals and aggressive musicianship made them one of the founding ""big four"" bands of thrash metal, alongside Megadeth, Anthrax and Slayer. Metallica's current lineup comprises founding members and primary songwriters Hetfield and Ulrich, longtime lead guitarist Kirk Hammett and bassist Robert Trujillo. Guitarist Dave Mustaine, who formed Megadeth after being fired from the band, and bassists Ron McGovney, Cliff Burton and Jason Newsted are former members of the band.
</p><p>Metallica first found commercial success with the release of its third album, <i>Master of Puppets</i> (1986), which is cited as one of the heaviest metal albums and the band's best work. The band's next album, <i>...And Justice for All</i> (1988), gave Metallica its first Grammy Award nomination. Its self-titled fifth album, <i>Metallica</i> (1991), was the band's first not to root predominantly in thrash metal; it appealed to a more mainstream audience, achieving substantial commercial success and selling over 16 million copies in the United States to date, making it the best-selling album of the SoundScan era. After experimenting with different genres and directions in subsequent releases, Metallica returned to its thrash metal roots with the release of its ninth album, <i>Death Magnetic</i> (2008), which drew similar praise to that of the band's earlier albums. This was followed by the band's 10th studio album, <i>Hardwired... to Self-Destruct</i> (2016), with its 11th album, <i>72 Seasons</i>, set for release in 2023.
</p><p>In 2000, Metallica led the case against the peer-to-peer file sharing service Napster, in which the band and several other artists filed lawsuits against the service for sharing their copyright-protected material without consent, eventually reaching a settlement. Metallica was the subject of the acclaimed 2004 documentary film <i>Metallica: Some Kind of Monster</i>, which documented the troubled production of the band's eighth album, <i>St. Anger</i> (2003), and the internal struggles within the band at the time. In 2009, Metallica was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The band co-wrote the screenplay for and starred alongside Dane DeHaan in the 2013 concert film <i>Metallica: Through the Never</i>, in which the band performed live against a fictional thriller storyline.
</p><p>Metallica has released 10 studio albums, four live albums (including two performances with the San Francisco Symphony), 12 video albums, a cover album, two extended plays, 37 singles and 39 music videos. The band has won nine Grammy Awards from 23 nominations, and its last six studio albums (beginning with <i>Metallica</i>) have consecutively debuted at No. 1 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200. Metallica ranks as one of the most commercially successful bands of all time, having sold over 125 million albums worldwide as of 2018. Metallica has been listed as one of the greatest artists of all time by magazines such as <i>Rolling Stone</i>, which ranked the band No. 61 on its <i>100 Greatest Artists of All Time</i> list. As of 2017, Metallica is the third-best-selling music artist since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales in 1991, selling a total of 58 million albums in the United States.</p>"
R.E.M.,Athens,1980–2011,R.E.M.,"<p><b>R.E.M.</b> was an American rock band from Athens, Georgia, formed in 1980 by drummer Bill Berry, guitarist Peter Buck, bassist Mike Mills, and lead vocalist Michael Stipe, who were students at the University of Georgia. One of the first alternative rock bands, R.E.M. was noted for Buck's ringing, arpeggiated guitar style; Stipe's distinctive vocal quality, unique stage presence, and obscure lyrics; Mills's melodic bass lines and backing vocals; and Berry's tight, economical drumming style. In the early 1990s, other alternative rock acts such as Nirvana and Pavement viewed R.E.M. as a pioneer of the genre. After Berry left the band in 1997, the band continued its career in the 2000s with mixed critical and commercial success. The band broke up amicably in 2011 with members devoting time to solo projects after having sold more than 90 million albums worldwide and becoming one of the world's best-selling music acts.
</p><p>R.E.M. released its first single, ""Radio Free Europe"", in 1981 on the independent record label Hib-Tone. It was followed by the <i>Chronic Town</i> EP in 1982, the band's first release on I.R.S. Records. In 1983, the group released its critically acclaimed debut album, <i>Murmur</i>, and built its reputation over the next few years with similarly acclaimed releases every year from 1984 to 1988: <i>Reckoning</i>, <i>Fables of the Reconstruction</i>, <i>Lifes Rich Pageant</i>, <i>Document</i> and <i>Green</i>, including an intermittent b-side compilation <i>Dead Letter Office</i>. Don Dixon and Mitch Easter produced their first two albums, Joe Boyd handled production on <i>Fables of the Reconstruction</i> and Don Gehman produced <i>Lifes Rich Pageant.</i> Thereafter, R.E.M. settled on Scott Litt as producer for the next 10<span> </span>years during the band's most successful period of their career. They also started co-producing their material and playing other instruments in the studio apart from the main ones they play. With constant touring, and the support of college radio following years of underground success, R.E.M. achieved a mainstream hit with the 1987 single ""The One I Love"". The group signed to Warner Bros. Records in 1988, and began to espouse political and environmental concerns while playing large arenas worldwide. They have since stated that the band was unlikely to reunite in several interviews.
</p><p>R.E.M.'s most commercially successful albums, <i>Out of Time</i> (1991) and <i>Automatic for the People</i> (1992), put them in the vanguard of alternative rock just as it was becoming mainstream. <i>Out of Time</i> received seven nominations at the 34th Annual Grammy Awards, and lead single ""Losing My Religion"", was R.E.M.'s highest-charting and best-selling hit. <i>Monster</i> (1994) continued its run of success. The band began its first tour in six years to support the album; the tour was marred by medical emergencies suffered by three of the band members. In 1996, R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. for a reported US$80 million, at the time the most expensive recording contract ever. The tour was productive and the band recorded the following album mostly during soundchecks. The resulting record, <i>New Adventures in Hi-Fi</i> (1996), is hailed as the band's last great album and the members' favorite, growing in cult status over the years. Berry left the band the following year, and Stipe, Buck, and Mills continued as a musical trio, supplemented by studio and live musicians, such as multi-instrumentalists Scott McCaughey and Ken Stringfellow and drummers Joey Waronker and Bill Rieflin. They also parted ways with their longtime manager Jefferson Holt and band's attorney Bertis Downs assumed managerial duties. Seeking to also renovate their sound, the band stopped working with Scott Litt, co-producer and contributor to six of their studio albums and hired Pat McCarthy as co-producer, who had participated before that as mixer and engineer on their last two albums.
</p><p>After the electronic experimental direction of <i>Up</i> (1998) that was commercially unsuccessful, <i>Reveal</i> (2001) was referred to as ""a conscious return to their classic sound"" which received general acclaim. In 2007, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, in its first year of eligibility and Berry reunited with the band for the ceremony and to record a cover of John Lennon's ""#9 Dream"" for the compilation album <i>Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur</i> to benefit Amnesty International's campaign to alleviate the Darfur conflict. Looking for a change of sound after lukewarm reception for <i>Around the Sun</i> (2004), the band collaborated with co-producer Jacknife Lee on their last two studio albums—the well-received <i>Accelerate</i> (2008) and <i>Collapse into Now</i> (2011)—as well as their first live albums after decades of touring. R.E.M. disbanded amicably in September 2011, with former members having continued with various musical projects, and several live and archival albums have since been released.

<p><b>Blur</b> are an English rock band formed in London in 1988. The band consists of singer Damon Albarn, guitarist Graham Coxon, bassist Alex James and drummer Dave Rowntree. Their debut album, <i>Leisure</i> (1991), incorporated the sounds of Madchester and shoegazing. Following a stylistic change influenced by English guitar pop groups such as the Kinks, the Beatles and XTC, Blur released <i>Modern Life Is Rubbish</i> (1993), <i>Parklife</i> (1994) and <i>The Great Escape</i> (1995). As a result, the band helped to popularise the Britpop genre and achieved mass popularity in the UK, aided by a chart battle with rival band Oasis in 1995 dubbed ""The Battle of Britpop"".
</p><p>Blur's self-titled fifth album (1997) saw another stylistic shift, influenced by the lo-fi styles of American indie rock groups, and became their third UK chart-topping album. Its single ""Song 2"" brought the band mainstream success in the US for the first time. Their next album, <i>13</i> (1999) saw the band experimenting with electronic and gospel music, and featured more personal lyrics from Albarn. Their seventh album, <i>Think Tank</i> (2003), continued their experimentation with electronic sounds and was also shaped by Albarn's growing interest in hip hop and world music, featuring more minimal guitar work. Coxon left the band during early recording sessions for <i>Think Tank</i>, and Blur disbanded for several years after the end of the album's associated tour, with the members engaged in other projects.
</p><p>In 2009, Blur reunited with Coxon back in the band and embarked on a European reunion tour. In the following years, they released several singles and compilations and toured internationally. In 2012, they received a Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. Their eighth album, <i>The Magic Whip</i> (2015), was the sixth consecutive Blur studio album to top the British chart. The group were largely on hiatus between the end of <i>the Magic Whip</i> tour and the announcement of a series of concert dates for 2023.

The current lineup features Corgan, Chamberlin, Iha and guitarist Jeff Schroeder.
</p><p>Disavowing the punk rock roots of many of their contemporaries, they have a diverse, densely-layered sound, containing elements of gothic rock, heavy metal, dream pop, psychedelic rock, progressive rock, shoegaze, and electronica in later recordings. Corgan is the group's primary composer; his musical versatility and cathartic lyrics have shaped the band's distinctive albums, which one writer described as ""anguished, bruised reports from Billy Corgan's nightmare-land"". With 30 million albums sold worldwide, the Smashing Pumpkins were one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands of the 1990s, often cited as an important act in the popularization of alternative rock music. However, internal conflicts, drug use, and diminishing sales led to a break-up in 2000.

<p><b>The Who</b> are an English rock band formed in London in 1964. Their core lineup consisted of lead vocalist Roger Daltrey, guitarist Pete Townshend, bassist John Entwistle and drummer Keith Moon. They are considered one of the most influential rock bands of the 20th century, and have sold over 100 million records worldwide. Their contributions to rock music include the development of the Marshall Stack, large PA systems, the use of the synthesizer, Entwistle and Moon's influential playing styles, Townshend's feedback and power chord guitar technique, and the development of the rock opera. They are cited as an influence by many hard rock, punk, power pop and mod bands, and their songs are still regularly played. The Who were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990. 
</p><p>The Who developed from an earlier group, the Detours, and established themselves as part of the pop art and mod movements, featuring auto-destructive art by destroying guitars and drums on stage. Their first single as the Who, ""I Can't Explain"" (1965), reached the UK top ten, and was followed by a string of hit singles including ""My Generation"" (1965), ""Substitute"" (1966) and ""Happy Jack"" (1966). In 1967, they performed at the Monterey Pop Festival and released ""I Can See for Miles"", their only US top-ten single. The group's 1969 concept album <i>Tommy</i> included the single ""Pinball Wizard"" and was a critical and commercial success.
</p><p>Further festival appearances at Woodstock and the Isle of Wight, along with the concert album <i>Live at Leeds</i> (1970), established their reputation as a respected rock act. The success put pressure on lead songwriter Townshend, and the follow-up to <i>Tommy</i>, <i>Lifehouse</i>, was abandoned. Songs from the project made up <i>Who's Next</i> (1971), including the hits ""Won't Get Fooled Again"", ""Baba O'Riley"", and ""Behind Blue Eyes"". The group released another concept album, <i>Quadrophenia</i> (1973), as a celebration of their mod roots, and oversaw the film adaptation of <i>Tommy</i> (1975). They continued to tour to large audiences before semi-retiring from live performances at the end of 1976. Unfortunately, the release of <i>Who Are You</i> (1978) was overshadowed by Moon's death shortly after.
</p><p>Kenney Jones replaced Moon and the group resumed touring, and released a film adaptation of <i>Quadrophenia</i> and the retrospective documentary <i>The Kids Are Alright</i>. After Townshend became weary of the group, they split in 1983. The Who occasionally re-formed for live appearances such as Live Aid in 1985, a 25th-anniversary tour in 1989 and a tour of <i>Quadrophenia</i> in 1996–1997. A full reunion began in 1999, with drummer Zak Starkey. After Entwistle's death in 2002, plans for a new album were delayed until 2006, with <i>Endless Wire</i>.  Since Entwistle's death, the Who have continued to perform and tour, most commonly with Starkey on drums, Pino Palladino on bass, and Pete's brother Simon Townshend on second guitar and backing vocals. In 2019, the group released the album <i>Who</i> and toured with a symphony orchestra.

The band consists of lead vocalist and guitarist Patrick Stump, bassist Pete Wentz, drummer Andy Hurley, and guitarist Joe Trohman. The band originated from Chicago's hardcore punk scene and was formed by Wentz and Trohman as a pop-punk side project; Stump joined shortly thereafter. The group went through a succession of drummers before Hurley joined. Their debut album, <i>Take This to Your Grave</i> (2003), became an underground success and helped the band gain a dedicated fanbase through heavy touring. <i>Take This to Your Grave</i> is cited as influential on pop-punk music in the 2000s.
</p><p>With Wentz as the band's lyricist and Stump as the primary composer, Fall Out Boy's 2005 major-label breakthrough, <i>From Under the Cork Tree</i>, produced two hit singles, ""Sugar, We're Goin Down"" and ""Dance, Dance"".

</p>
<p><b>AC/DC</b> (stylised as <b>ACϟDC</b>) are an Australian rock band formed in Sydney in 1973 by Scottish-born Australian brothers Malcolm (rhythm guitar) and Angus Young (lead guitar). Their music has been variously described as hard rock, blues rock, and heavy metal, but the band calls it simply ""rock and roll"".</p><p>AC/DC underwent several line-up changes before releasing their first album, <i>High Voltage</i> (1975). Membership subsequently stabilised around the Young brothers with fellow Scottish-born Australian Bon Scott (lead vocals) alongside native Australians Mark Evans (bass) and Phil Rudd (drums). Evans was fired from the band in 1977 and replaced by Cliff Williams, who has since appeared on every album since <i>Powerage</i> (1978). Seven months after the release of the band's breakthrough album <i>Highway to Hell</i> (1979), Scott died of alcohol poisoning and the other members considered disbanding. However, at the request of Scott's parents, they continued together and recruited English singer Brian Johnson as their new frontman. Their first album with Johnson, <i>Back in Black</i> (1980), was dedicated to Scott's memory. It was a widespread success, launching the band to new heights and becoming the second best-selling album of all time.
</p><p>The band's eighth studio album, <i>For Those About to Rock</i> (1981), was their first album to reach number one in the United States. Prior to the release of their next album, <i>Flick of the Switch</i> (1983), Rudd left the band and was replaced by Simon Wright, who was himself replaced by Chris Slade six years later. The band experienced a commercial resurgence in the early 1990s with the release of their 12th studio album <i>The Razors Edge</i> (1990); it was their only album to feature Slade, who was replaced by the returning Rudd in 1994. Rudd has since recorded five more albums with the band, starting with <i>Ballbreaker</i> (1995). Their 15th studio album <i>Black Ice</i> was the second-highest-selling album of 2008 and their biggest chart hit since <i>For Those About to Rock</i>, eventually reaching No. 1 worldwide.</p><p>The band's line-up remained the same for 20 years until 2014, when Malcolm Young retired due to early-onset dementia (from which he died three years later) and Rudd became involved in legal troubles. Malcolm was replaced by his nephew Stevie Young, who debuted on the album <i>Rock or Bust</i> (2014). On the accompanying tour, previous drummer Chris Slade filled in for Rudd. In 2016, Johnson was advised to stop touring due to worsening hearing loss, and ex-Guns N' Roses singer Axl Rose stepped in as the band's frontman for the remainder of that year's dates. Long-time bassist and backing vocalist Williams retired at the end of the <i>Rock or Bust</i> tour in 2016, and the group entered a four-year hiatus. A reunion of the <i>Rock or Bust</i> line-up was announced in September 2020, and the band's 17th studio album <i>Power Up</i> was released two months later.
</p><p>AC/DC have sold more than 200 million records worldwide, including 75 million albums in the United States, making them the ninth-highest-selling artist in the United States and the 16th-best-selling artist worldwide. <i>Back in Black</i> has sold an estimated 50 million units worldwide, making it the second best-selling album of all time and the highest-selling album by a band. The album has sold 25 million units in the US, where it is the fourth best-selling album of all time. AC/DC were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2003. They ranked fourth on <i>VH1</i><span>'s</span> list of the ""100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock"" and were named the seventh ""Greatest Heavy Metal Band of All Time"" by MTV. In 2004, they ranked No. 72 on the <i>Rolling Stone</i> list of the ""100 Greatest Artists of All Time"". American record producer Rick Rubin, who wrote an essay on the band for <i>Rolling Stone</i>, called them the ""greatest rock and roll band of all time"". In 2010, <i>VH1</i> ranked them No. 23 on its list of the ""100 Greatest Artists of All Time"".</p>

</p><p>Depeche Mode, originally formed by the lineup of Gahan, Gore, Andy Fletcher and Vince Clarke, released their debut album <i>Speak &amp; Spell</i> in 1981, bringing the band onto the British new wave scene. After founding member Clarke left following the release of the album, they recorded <i>A Broken Frame</i> as a trio. Gore took over as main songwriter and later, in 1982, Alan Wilder replaced Clarke, establishing a lineup that continued for 13 years. The band's last albums of the 1980s, <i>Black Celebration</i> and <i>Music for the Masses</i>, established them as a dominant force within the electronic music scene. A highlight of this era was the band's June 1988 concert at the Pasadena Rose Bowl, where they drew a crowd in excess of 60,000 people. In early 1990, they released <i>Violator</i>, an international mainstream success. The following album <i>Songs of Faith and Devotion</i>, released in 1993, was also a success, though the band's internal struggles during recording and touring resulted in Wilder's departure in 1995. The band continued with the trio lineup of Gahan, Gore, and Fletcher until Fletcher's death in 2022.
</p><p>Depeche Mode have had 54 songs in the UK Singles Chart and 17 Top 10 albums in the UK chart; they have sold more than 100 million records worldwide. <i>Q</i> included the band in its list of the ""50 Bands That Changed the World!""

Bob Dylan,The Forward,,Bob Dylan,"<p class=""mw-empty-elt"">



</p>
<p><b>Bob Dylan</b> (legally <b>Robert Dylan</b>, born <b>Robert Allen Zimmerman</b>, May 24, 1941) is an American singer-songwriter. Often regarded as one of the greatest songwriters of all time, Dylan has been a major figure in popular culture during a career spanning more than 60 years. Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s, when songs such as ""Blowin' in the Wind"" (1963) and ""The Times They Are a-Changin'<span>""</span> (1964) became anthems for the civil rights and antiwar movements. His lyrics during this period incorporated a range of political, social, philosophical, and literary influences, defying pop music conventions and appealing to the burgeoning counterculture.</p><p>Following his self-titled debut album in 1962, which comprised mainly traditional folk songs, Dylan made his breakthrough as a songwriter with the release of <i>The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan</i> the following year. The album features ""Blowin' in the Wind"" and the thematically complex ""A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall"". Many of his songs adapted the tunes and phraseology of older folk songs. He went on to release the politically charged <i>The Times They Are a-Changin'</i> and the more lyrically abstract and introspective <i>Another Side of Bob Dylan</i> in 1964. In 1965 and 1966, Dylan drew controversy among folk purists when he adopted electrically amplified rock instrumentation, and in the space of 15 months recorded three of the most important and influential rock albums of the 1960s: <i>Bringing It All Back Home</i>, <i>Highway 61 Revisited</i> (both 1965) and <i>Blonde on Blonde</i> (1966). His six-minute single ""Like a Rolling Stone"" (1965) expanded commercial and creative boundaries in popular music.</p><p>In July 1966, a motorcycle accident led to Dylan's withdrawal from touring. During this period, he recorded a large body of songs with members of the Band, who had previously backed him on tour. These recordings were released as the collaborative album <i>The Basement Tapes</i> in 1975. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Dylan explored country music and rural themes in <i>John Wesley Harding</i> (1967), <i>Nashville Skyline</i> (1969), and <i>New Morning</i> (1970). In 1975, he released <i>Blood on the Tracks</i>, which many saw as a return to form. In the late 1970s, he became a born-again Christian and released a series of albums of contemporary gospel music before returning to his more familiar rock-based idiom in the early 1980s. Dylan's 1997 album <i>Time Out of Mind</i> marked the beginning of a renaissance for his career. He has released five critically acclaimed albums of original material since then, the most recent being <i>Rough and Rowdy Ways</i> (2020). He also recorded a series of three albums in the 2010s comprising versions of traditional American standards, especially songs recorded by Frank Sinatra. Dylan has toured continuously since the late 1980s on what has become known as the Never Ending Tour.</p><p>Since 1994, Dylan has published nine books of drawings and paintings, and his work has been exhibited in major art galleries. He has sold more than 125 million records, making him one of the best-selling musicians of all time. He has received numerous awards, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom, ten Grammy Awards, a Golden Globe Award and an Academy Award. Dylan has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame. The Pulitzer Prize Board in 2008 awarded him a special citation for ""his profound impact on popular music and American culture, marked by lyrical compositions of extraordinary poetic power"". In 2016, Dylan was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature ""for having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition"".</p>

</p>

<p><b>John Clayton Mayer</b> (<span></span> <i title=""English pronunciation respelling""><span>MAY</span>-ər</i>; born October 16, 1977) is an American singer, songwriter, and guitarist. Born and raised in Fairfield County, Connecticut, Mayer attended Berklee College of Music in Boston, but left   and moved to Atlanta in 1997 with Clay Cook. Together, they formed a short-lived two-man band called Lo-Fi Masters. After their split, Mayer continued to play local clubs, refining his skills and gaining a following. After his appearance at the 2001 South by Southwest festival, he was signed to Aware Records, and eventually to Columbia Records, which released his first extended play <i>Inside Wants Out</i>. His following two studio albums—<i>Room for Squares</i> (2001) and <i>Heavier Things</i> (2003)—performed well commercially, achieving multi-platinum status. In 2003, he won the Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for his single ""Your Body Is a Wonderland"".
</p><p>By 2005, Mayer had moved away from the acoustic music that characterized his early records, and begun performing the blues and rock music that had originally influenced him as a musician. He collaborated with blues artists such as B.B. King, Buddy Guy, and Eric Clapton. Forming the John Mayer Trio, he released a live album, <i>Try!</i>, in 2005 and his third studio album <i>Continuum</i> in 2006. Both albums received positive reviews, and <i>Continuum</i> earned Mayer a 2007 Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album. He also won Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for ""Waiting on the World to Change"". That album was followed by <i>Battle Studies</i> in 2009, a return to pop, with a Battle Studies World Tour.
</p><p>After having several controversial incidents with the media, Mayer withdrew from public life in 2010 and began work on his fifth studio album, <i>Born and Raised</i>, which drew inspiration from the 1970s pop music of Laurel Canyon. However, the discovery of a granuloma on his vocal cords delayed the release of the album until May 2012, and forced him to cancel the planned tour. The album received a generally favorable reception, though was less commercially successful than his previous work. Mayer began performing as a singer again in January 2013, and that year released his sixth studio album, <i>Paradise Valley</i>, which incorporates country music influences. By 2014, he had sold a total of over 20 million albums worldwide. His seventh album, <i>The Search for Everything</i>, a loose concept album based around the theme of a romantic break-up, was released in 2017. Mayer released his latest album, <i>Sob Rock</i>, inspired by 1980s soft rock music, in July 2021.
</p><p>In 2015, three former members of the Grateful Dead joined with Mayer and two other musicians to form the band Dead &amp; Company. It is the latest of several reunions of the band's surviving members since Jerry Garcia's death in 1995. The band remains active and its tours have been well received.</p><p>Mayer's secondary career pursuits extend to television hosting, comedy, and writing; he has authored columns for magazines such as <i>Esquire</i>. He supports various causes and has performed at charity benefits. He is a watch aficionado (with a collection he values in the ""tens of millions"" of dollars), contributing to the watch site <i>Hodinkee</i>, and has been on the jury at the <i>Grand Prix d'Horlogerie de Genève</i>.</p>

Black Sabbath,Birmingham,1968–2017 ,Black Sabbath,"<p class=""mw-empty-elt"">



</p>
<p><b>Black Sabbath</b> were an English rock band formed in Birmingham in 1968 by guitarist Tony Iommi, drummer Bill Ward, bassist Geezer Butler and vocalist Ozzy Osbourne. They are often cited as pioneers of heavy metal music. The band helped define the genre with releases such as <i>Black Sabbath</i> (1970), <i>Paranoid</i> (1970) and <i>Master of Reality</i> (1971). The band had multiple line-up changes following Osbourne's departure in 1979 and Iommi is the only constant member throughout their history.
</p><p>After previous iterations of the group – the Polka Tulk Blues Band and Earth – the band settled on the name Black Sabbath in 1969. They distinguished themselves through occult themes with horror-inspired lyrics and down-tuned guitars. Signing to Philips Records in November 1969, they released their first single, ""Evil Woman"", in January 1970, and their debut album, <i>Black Sabbath</i>, was released the following month. Though it received a negative critical response, the album was a commercial success, leading to a follow-up record, <i>Paranoid</i>, later that year. The band's popularity grew, and by 1973's <i>Sabbath Bloody Sabbath</i>, critics were starting to respond favourably.
</p><p>Osbourne's excessive substance abuse led to his firing in 1979. He was replaced by former Rainbow vocalist Ronnie James Dio. Following two albums with Dio, <i>Heaven and Hell</i> and <i>Mob Rules</i>, the second of which saw drummer Vinny Appice replace Ward, Black Sabbath endured many personnel changes from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s that included vocalists Ian Gillan, Glenn Hughes, Ray Gillen and Tony Martin, as well as several drummers and bassists, with Butler's departure in 1984 leaving Iommi as the only remaining original member. Martin, who replaced Gillen in 1987, was the second-longest serving vocalist after Osbourne and recorded three albums with Black Sabbath before his dismissal in 1991. That same year, Iommi rejoined with Butler, Dio and Appice to record <i>Dehumanizer</i> (1992). After two more studio albums with Martin, who returned to replace Dio in 1993, the band's original line-up reunited in 1997 and released a live album, <i>Reunion,</i> the following year; they continued to tour occasionally until 2005. Other than various back catalogue reissues and compilation albums, as well as the <i>Mob Rules</i>-era line-up reuniting as Heaven &amp; Hell, there was no further activity under the Black Sabbath name until 2011 with the release of their final studio album and 19th overall, <i>13</i>, in 2013, which features all of the original members except Ward. During their farewell tour, the band played their final concert in their home city of Birmingham on 4 February 2017. Occasional partial reunions have happened since, most recently when Osbourne and Iommi performed together at the closing ceremony of the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham.</p><p>Black Sabbath have sold over 70 million records worldwide as of 2013, making them one of the most commercially successful heavy metal bands. Black Sabbath, together with Deep Purple and Led Zeppelin, have been referred to as the ""unholy trinity of British hard rock and heavy metal in the early to mid-seventies"". They were ranked by MTV as the ""Greatest Metal Band of All Time"" and placed second on VH1's ""100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock"" list. <i>Rolling Stone</i> magazine ranked them number 85 on their ""100 Greatest Artists of All Time"". Black Sabbath were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006. They have also won two Grammy Awards for Best Metal Performance, and in 2019 the band were presented a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.</p>"

The Beach Boys,Hawthorne,1961–present,The Beach Boys,"<p class=""mw-empty-elt"">

</p>
<p><b>The Beach Boys</b> are an American rock band that formed in Hawthorne, California, in 1961. The group's original lineup consisted of brothers Brian, Dennis, and Carl Wilson, their cousin Mike Love, and friend Al Jardine. Distinguished by their vocal harmonies,  adolescent-themed lyrics, and  musical ingenuity, they are one of the most influential acts of the rock era. They drew on the music of older pop vocal groups, 1950s rock and roll, and black R&amp;B to create their unique sound. Under Brian's direction, they often incorporated classical or jazz elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways.
</p><p>The Beach Boys began as a garage band, managed by the Wilsons' father, Murry, with Brian serving as composer, arranger, producer, and <i>de facto</i> leader. In 1963, they enjoyed their first national hit with ""Surfin' U.S.A."", beginning a string of top-ten singles that reflected a southern California youth culture of surfing, cars, and romance, dubbed the ""California sound"". They were one of the few American rock bands to sustain their commercial standing during the British Invasion. Starting with 1965's <i>The Beach Boys Today!</i>, they abandoned beachgoing themes for more personal lyrics and ambitious orchestrations. In 1966, the <i>Pet Sounds</i> album and ""Good Vibrations"" single raised the group's prestige as rock innovators. After scrapping the <i>Smile</i> album in 1967, Brian gradually ceded control of the group to his bandmates.
</p><p>In the late 1960s, the group's commercial momentum faltered in the US, and despite efforts to maintain an experimental sound, they were widely dismissed by the early rock music press. After Carl took over as  musical leader, the band made records that would later enjoy a cult following among fans. In the mid-1970s, as their concerts drew larger audiences, the band transitioned into an oldies act. Dennis drowned in 1983 and Brian soon became estranged from the group. Following Carl's death from lung cancer in 1998, the band granted Love legal rights to tour under the group's name. In the early 2010s, the original members briefly reunited for the band's 50th anniversary. As of 2022, Brian and Jardine do not perform with Love's edition of the Beach Boys, but remain official members of the band.
</p><p>
The Beach Boys are one of the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful bands of all time, selling over 100 million records worldwide. They helped legitimize popular music as a recognized art form and influenced the development of music genres and movements such as psychedelia, power pop, progressive rock, punk, alternative, and lo-fi. Between the 1960s and 2020s, the group had 37 songs reach the US Top 40 (the most by an American band), with four topping the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. In 2004, they were ranked number 12 on <i>Rolling Stone</i><span>'</span>s list of the greatest artists of all time.

After their divorce in the 1960s, Margaret soon claimed credit, which was established after a court ""paint-off"" in Hawaii.</p><p>A resurgence of interest in Margaret Keane's work followed the release of Tim Burton's 2014 biopic <i>Big Eyes</i>.

In June 1965, a new version of ""The Sound of Silence"" an acoustic song on the duo’s debut album, was overdubbed with electric guitar and drums and became a US AM radio hit, reaching number one on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. The duo reunited to release a second studio album, <i>Sounds of Silence,</i> and tour colleges nationwide. On their third release, <i>Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme</i> (1966), they assumed more creative control. Their music was featured in the 1967 film <i>The Graduate</i>, giving them further exposure. Their next album <i>Bookends</i> (1968) topped the <i>Billboard</i> 200 chart and included the number-one single ""Mrs. Robinson"" from the film.
</p><p>Simon and Garfunkel had a troubled relationship, leading to artistic disagreements and their breakup in 1970. Their final studio album, <i>Bridge over Troubled Water</i>, was released that January, becoming one of the world's best-selling albums. After their breakup, Simon released a number of acclaimed albums, including 1986's <i>Graceland</i>. Garfunkel released solo hits such as ""All I Know"" and briefly pursued an acting career, with leading roles in the Mike Nichols films <i>Catch-22</i> and <i>Carnal Knowledge</i> and in Nicolas Roeg's 1980 <i>Bad Timing.</i>  The duo have reunited several times; their 1981 concert in Central Park may have attracted more than 500,000 people, one of the largest concert attendances in history.</p><p>Simon &amp; Garfunkel won 7 Grammy Awards and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990. Richie Unterberger described them as ""the most successful folk-rock duo of the 1960s"" and one of the most popular artists from the decade.

</p>
<p><b>Creedence Clearwater Revival</b>, also abbreviated as <b>CCR</b>, was an American rock band formed in El Cerrito, California. The band initially consisted of lead vocalist, lead guitarist, and primary songwriter John Fogerty; his brother, rhythm guitarist Tom Fogerty; bassist Stu Cook; and drummer Doug Clifford. These members had played together since 1959, first as the Blue Velvets and later as the Golliwogs, before settling on Creedence Clearwater Revival in 1967.</p><p>CCR's musical style encompassed roots rock, swamp rock, blues rock, Southern rock, and country rock, among others. Belying their origins in the East Bay subregion of the San Francisco Bay Area, the band often played in a Southern rock style, with lyrics about bayous, catfish, the Mississippi River and other elements of Southern United States iconography. The band's songs rarely dealt with romantic love, concentrating instead on political and socially conscious lyrics about topics such as the Vietnam War. The band's most prolific and successful period between 1969 and 1971 produced fourteen consecutive top 10 singles (many of which were double A-sides) and five consecutive top 10 albums in the United States – two of which, <i>Green River</i> (1969) and <i>Cosmo's Factory</i> (1970), reached number one. The band performed at the 1969 Woodstock festival in Upstate New York, and was the first major act signed to appear there.</p><p>CCR disbanded acrimoniously in late 1972 after four years of chart-topping success. Tom Fogerty had left the previous year, and John was at odds with the remaining members over matters of business and artistic control, all of which resulted in lawsuits among the former bandmates. Fogerty's disagreements with Fantasy Records owner Saul Zaentz led to more court cases and John Fogerty refused to perform with the two other surviving members at Creedence's 1993 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Though the band has never officially reunited, John Fogerty continues to perform CCR songs as part of his solo act, while Cook and Clifford have performed as Creedence Clearwater <i>Revisited</i> since the 1990s.
</p><p>CCR's music remains a staple of U.S. classic rock radio airplay; 28 million CCR records have been sold in the U.S. alone. The compilation album <i>Chronicle: The 20 Greatest Hits</i>, originally released in 1976, is still on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 album chart and reached the 500-weeks mark in December 2020. It has been awarded 10× platinum.</p>"

They recorded their first demos while they were in high school. Shortly after, the band recorded and released their debut studio album, <i>A Fever You Can't Sweat Out</i> (2005). Popularized by the second single, ""I Write Sins Not Tragedies"", the album was certified triple platinum in the US. In 2006, founding bassist Brent Wilson was fired from the band during an extensive world tour and subsequently replaced by Jon Walker. The band's second album, <i>Pretty. Odd.</i> (2008), was preceded by the single ""Nine in the Afternoon"". That album marked a significant departure from the sound of the band's debut. Ross and Walker, who favored the band's new direction, departed because Urie and Smith wanted to make further changes to the band's style. Ross and Walker subsequently formed a new band, the Young Veins, leaving Urie and Smith as the sole remaining members of Panic! at the Disco.

He is widely considered one of the most influential rappers of all time. Shakur is among the best-selling music artists, having sold more than 75 million records worldwide. Much of Shakur's music has been noted for addressing contemporary social issues that plagued inner cities, and he is considered a symbol of activism against inequality.
</p><p>Shakur was born in New York City to parents who were both political activists and Black Panther Party members. Raised by his mother, Afeni Shakur, he relocated to Baltimore in 1984 and to the San Francisco Bay Area in 1988. With the release of his debut album <i>2Pacalypse Now</i> in 1991, he became a central figure in West Coast hip hop for his conscious rap lyrics. Shakur achieved further critical and commercial success with his follow-up albums <i>Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...</i> (1993) and <i>Me Against the World</i> (1995). His Diamond certified album <i>All Eyez on Me</i> (1996), the first double-length album in hip-hop history, abandoned his introspective lyrics for volatile gangsta rap. In addition to his music career, Shakur also found considerable success as an actor, with his starring roles in <i>Juice</i> (1992), <i>Poetic Justice</i> (1993), <i>Above the Rim</i> (1994), <i>Bullet</i> (1996), <i>Gridlock'd</i> (1997), and <i>Gang Related</i> (1997).
</p><p>During the later part of his career, Shakur was shot five times in the lobby of a New York recording studio and experienced legal troubles, including incarceration. In 1995, Shakur served eight months in prison on sexual abuse charges, but was released pending an appeal of his conviction. Following his release, he signed to Marion ""Suge"" Knight's label Death Row Records and became heavily involved in the growing East Coast–West Coast hip hop rivalry. On September 7, 1996, Shakur was shot four times by an unidentified assailant in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas; he died six days later. Following his murder, Shakur's friend-turned-rival, the Notorious B.I.G., was at first considered a suspect due to their public feud; he was also murdered in another drive-by shooting six months later in March 1997 while visiting Los Angeles.</p><p>Shakur's double-length posthumous album <i>Greatest Hits</i> (1998) is one of his two releases—and one of only nine hip hop albums—to have been certified Diamond in the United States. Five more albums have been released since Shakur's death, including his critically acclaimed posthumous album <i>The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory</i> (1996) under his stage name Makaveli, all of which have been certified Platinum in the United States. In 2002, Shakur was inducted into the Hip-Hop Hall of Fame. In 2017, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility. <i>Rolling Stone</i> ranked Shakur among the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.</p>

</p>
<p><b>Nine Inch Nails</b>, commonly abbreviated as <b>NIN</b> and stylized as <b>NIИ</b>, is an American industrial rock band formed in Cleveland in 1988. Singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and producer Trent Reznor was the only permanent member of the band until his frequent collaborator, Atticus Ross, joined in 2016. The band's debut album, <i>Pretty Hate Machine</i> (1989), was released via TVT Records. After disagreeing with TVT about how to promote the album, the band signed with Interscope Records and released the EP <i>Broken</i> (1992). The following albums, <i>The Downward Spiral</i> (1994) and <i>The Fragile</i> (1999), were released to critical acclaim and commercial success.
</p><p>Following a hiatus, Nine Inch Nails resumed touring in 2005 and released the album <i>With Teeth</i> (2005). Following the release of the album <i>Year Zero</i> (2007), the band left Interscope after a feud. Nine Inch Nails continued touring and independently released <i>Ghosts I–IV</i> (2008) and <i>The Slip</i> (2008) before a second hiatus. Their eighth album, <i>Hesitation Marks</i> (2013), was followed by a trilogy which consisted of the EPs <i>Not the Actual Events</i> (2016) and <i>Add Violence</i> (2017) and their ninth album <i>Bad Witch</i> (2018). In 2020, Nine Inch Nails simultaneously released two further instalments in the <i>Ghosts</i> series: <i>Ghosts V: Together</i> and <i>Ghosts VI: Locusts</i>.
</p><p>When touring, Reznor typically assembles a live band to perform with him under the Nine Inch Nails name. This live band has varied over the decades, with various members leaving and returning; the most recent lineup consists of Robin Finck (who initially joined in 1994), Alessandro Cortini (who initially joined in 2005), and Ilan Rubin (who initially joined in 2009) alongside Reznor and Ross. The band's concerts are noted for their extensive use of thematic visual elements, complex special effects, and elaborate lighting. Songs are often rearranged to fit any given performance, and melodies or lyrics of songs that are not scheduled to be performed are sometimes assimilated into other songs.
</p><p>Nine Inch Nails have sold over 20 million records and been nominated for 13 Grammy Awards, winning for the songs ""Wish"" in 1992 and ""Happiness in Slavery"" in 1996. <i>Time</i> magazine named Reznor one of its most influential people in 1997, while <i>Spin</i> magazine has described him as ""the most vital artist in music"". In 2004, <i>Rolling Stone</i> placed Nine Inch Nails at No. 94 on its list of the 100 greatest artists of all time. Nine Inch Nails were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2020, after being nominated in 2014 (their first year of eligibility) and again in 2015.

</p>
<p><b>The Black Keys</b> are an American rock duo formed in Akron, Ohio, in 2001. The group consists of Dan Auerbach (guitar, vocals) and Patrick Carney (drums). The duo began as an independent act, recording music in basements and self-producing their records, before they eventually emerged as one of the most popular garage rock artists during a second wave of the genre's revival in the 2000s. The band's raw blues rock sound draws heavily from Auerbach's blues influences, including Junior Kimbrough, R.L. Burnside, Howlin' Wolf, and Robert Johnson.
</p><p>Friends since childhood, Auerbach and Carney founded the group after dropping out of college. After signing with indie label Alive, they released their debut album, <i>The Big Come Up</i> (2002), which earned them a new deal with Fat Possum Records. Over the next decade, the Black Keys built an underground fanbase through extensive touring of small clubs, frequent album releases and music festival appearances, and broad licensing of their songs. Their third album, <i>Rubber Factory</i> (2004), received critical acclaim and boosted the band's profile, eventually leading to a record deal with major label Nonesuch Records in 2006. After self-producing and recording their first four records in makeshift studios, the duo completed <i>Attack &amp; Release</i> (2008) in a professional studio and hired producer Danger Mouse, who subsequently became a frequent collaborator with the band.
</p><p>The group's commercial breakthrough came in 2010 with <i>Brothers</i>, which along with its popular single ""Tighten Up"", won three Grammy Awards. Their 2011 follow-up <i>El Camino</i> received strong reviews and peaked at number two on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 chart, leading to the first arena concert tour of the band's career, the El Camino Tour. The album and its hit single ""Lonely Boy"" won three Grammy Awards. In 2014, they released their eighth album, <i>Turn Blue</i>, their first number-one record in the US, Canada, and Australia. After completing the Turn Blue Tour in 2015, the duo took a hiatus for several years to work on side projects and produce other artists. They returned in 2019 with their ninth album, <i>Let's Rock</i>; their tenth studio album <i>Delta Kream</i> was released in 2021 and consists of hill country blues covers.</p>

Fleetwood Mac,London,1967–1995,Fleetwood Mac,"<p class=""mw-empty-elt"">

</p>
<p><b>Fleetwood Mac</b> are a British-American rock band, formed in London in 1967. Fleetwood Mac were founded by guitarists and vocalists Peter Green and Jeremy Spencer, and drummer Mick Fleetwood. Bob Brunning was hired as a temporary bass guitarist before John McVie joined the line-up in time for their eponymous debut album. Danny Kirwan joined as a third guitarist and vocalist in 1968. Keyboardist and vocalist Christine Perfect, who contributed as a session musician from the second album onwards, married McVie and joined in 1970, becoming known as Christine McVie.
</p><p>Primarily a British blues band at first, Fleetwood Mac achieved a UK number one with ""Albatross"", and had other hits such as the singles ""Oh Well"", ""Man of the World"", and ""The Green Manalishi"". Green, Spencer and Kirwan all left in succession during the early 1970s, replaced by guitarist and vocalist Bob Welch, guitarist Bob Weston and vocalist Dave Walker. By 1974, Welch, Weston and Walker had all either departed or been dismissed, leaving the band without a male vocalist or a guitarist. In late 1974, while Fleetwood was scouting studios in Los Angeles, he heard the American folk-rock duo Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks. He asked Buckingham to be their new guitarist and vocalist with Buckingham agreeing on the condition that Nicks could also join as vocalist.
</p><p>The addition of Buckingham and Nicks gave the band a more pop rock sound and their 1975 album <i>Fleetwood Mac</i> reached No. 1 in the United States. <i>Rumours</i> (1977) produced four U.S. Top 10 singles and remained at number one on the American albums chart for 31 weeks. It also reached the top spot in countries around the world and won a Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1978. <i>Rumours</i> has sold more than 40 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums in history. Although each member of the band went through a breakup (John and Christine McVie, Buckingham and Nicks, and Fleetwood and his wife Jenny) while recording the album, they continued to write and record together.
</p><p>The lineup remained stable through three more studio albums, but by the late 1980s began to disintegrate. After Buckingham and Nicks left, they were replaced by a number of other guitarists and vocalists. A 1993 one-off performance for the first inauguration of President Bill Clinton reunited Fleetwood, Nicks and Buckingham, and John and Christine McVie for the first time in six years. A full reunion occurred four years later, and Fleetwood Mac released their fourth U.S. No. 1 album, <i>The Dance</i> (1997), a live compilation of their hits, also marking the 20th anniversary of <i>Rumours</i>. Christine McVie left in 1998, but continued to work with the band in a session capacity. They continued as a four-piece, releasing their most recent studio album, <i>Say You Will</i>, in 2003. Christine McVie rejoined in 2014. In 2018, Buckingham was fired and replaced by Mike Campbell, formerly of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers and Neil Finn of Split Enz and Crowded House. Christine McVie died in 2022.
</p><p>Fleetwood Mac have sold more than 120 million records worldwide, making them one of the world's best-selling bands. In 1979, the group were honoured with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 1998 the band were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and received the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. In 2018, the band received the MusiCares Person of the Year award from The Recording Academy in recognition of their artistic achievement in the music industry and dedication to philanthropy.

They were active from 1977 to 1988 and again from 1990 to 1995.</p><p>Their first single, ""Sultans of Swing"", from their 1978 self-titled debut album, reached the top ten in the UK and US charts. It was followed by hit singles including ""Romeo and Juliet"" (1981), ""Private Investigations"" (1982), ""Twisting by the Pool"" (1983), ""Money for Nothing"" (1985), and ""Walk of Life"" (1985). Their most commercially successful album, <i>Brothers in Arms</i> (1985), has sold more than 30 million copies; it was the first album to sell a million copies on compact disc and is the eighth-bestselling album in UK history.  According to the <i>Guinness Book of British Hit Albums</i>, Dire Straits have spent over 1,100 weeks on the UK albums chart, the fifth most of all time.</p><p>Dire Straits' sound draws from various influences, including country, folk, the blues rock of J. J. Cale, and jazz. Their stripped-down sound contrasted with punk rock and demonstrated a roots rock influence that emerged from pub rock. There were several changes in personnel, with Mark Knopfler and Illsley being the only members who lasted from the beginning of the band's existence to the end. After their first breakup in 1988, Knopfler told <i>Rolling Stone</i>: ""A lot of press reports were saying we were the biggest band in the world. There's not an accent then on the music, there's an accent on popularity. I needed a rest."" They disbanded for good in 1995, after which Knopfler launched a solo career full-time. He has since declined numerous reunion offers.</p><p>Dire Straits were called ""the biggest British rock band of the 80s"" by <i>Classic Rock</i> magazine; their 1985–1986 world tour, which included a performance at Live Aid in July 1985, set a record in Australasia. Their final world tour from 1991 to 1992 sold 7.1 million tickets. Dire Straits won four Grammy Awards, three Brit Awards (Best British Group twice), two MTV Video Music Awards, and various other awards. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2018. Dire Straits have sold over 120 million units worldwide, including 51.4 million certified units, making them one of the best-selling music artists.</p>"

</p>
<p><b>Deep Purple</b> are an English rock band formed in London in 1968. They are considered to be among the pioneers of heavy metal and modern hard rock, but their musical approach has changed over the years. Originally formed as a psychedelic rock and progressive rock band, they shifted to a heavier sound with their 1970 album <i>Deep Purple in Rock</i>. Deep Purple, together with Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath, have been referred to as the ""unholy trinity of British hard rock and heavy metal in the early to mid-seventies"". They were listed in the 1975 <i>Guinness Book of World Records</i> as ""the globe's loudest band"" for a 1972 concert at London's Rainbow Theatre and have sold over 100 million albums worldwide.</p><p>Deep Purple have had several line-up changes and an eight-year hiatus (1976–1984). The first four line-ups, which constituted the band's original 1968–1976 run, are officially indicated as Mark I (1968–1969), Mark II (1969–1973), Mark III (1973–1975) and Mark IV (1975–1976). Mark I comprised the founding members of Deep Purple, Ritchie Blackmore (guitar), Rod Evans (vocals), Jon Lord (keyboards), Ian Paice (drums) and Nick Simper (bass), while Mark II was the most commercially successful line-up, with Ian Gillan (vocals) and Roger Glover (bass) replacing Evans and Simper. Mark III saw David Coverdale (vocals) and Glenn Hughes (bass and vocals) replace Gillan and Glover, while Mark IV featured Tommy Bolin (guitar) replacing Blackmore. Mark II was revived from 1984–1989 and again from 1992–1993, with Joe Lynn Turner (vocals) replacing Gillan in the intervening 1989–1992 period. Mark II definitively ended in 1993, when Blackmore left Deep Purple for the second and final time. He was replaced temporarily by Joe Satriani (guitar) and then permanently by Steve Morse (guitar). In 2002 Don Airey (keyboards) replaced Lord, which saw Deep Purple settle into its longest running line-up, unchanged for the next twenty years, until Morse announced his departure from the band in 2022. His place was taken by Simon McBride (guitar). Ian Paice, Roger Glover, Ian Gillan, Don Airey and Simon McBride comprise the current line-up of Deep Purple.
</p><p>Deep Purple were ranked number 22 on VH1's <i>Greatest Artists of Hard Rock</i> programme, and a poll on radio station Planet Rock ranked them 5th among the ""most influential bands ever"". The band received the Legend Award at the 2008 World Music Awards. Deep Purple (specifically Blackmore, Lord, Paice, Gillan, Glover, Coverdale, Evans, and Hughes) were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2016.

</p>
<p><b>The Kinks</b> were an English rock band formed in Muswell Hill, North London, in 1963 by brothers Ray and Dave Davies. They are regarded as one of the most influential rock bands of the 1960s. The band emerged during the height of British rhythm and blues and Merseybeat, and were briefly part of the British Invasion of the United States until their touring ban in 1965. Their third single, the Ray Davies-penned ""You Really Got Me"", became an international hit, topping the charts in the United Kingdom and reaching the Top 10 in the United States.</p><p>The Kinks' music drew from a wide range of influences, including American R&amp;B and rock and roll initially, and later adopting British music hall, folk, and country. The band gained a reputation for reflecting English culture and lifestyle, fuelled by Ray Davies' wittily observational writing style, and made apparent in albums such as <i>Face to Face</i> (1966), <i>Something Else</i> (1967), <i>The Village Green Preservation Society</i> (1968), <i>Arthur</i> (1969), <i>Lola Versus Powerman</i> (1970), and <i>Muswell Hillbillies</i> (1971), along with their accompanying singles including the transatlantic hit ""Lola"" (1970). After a fallow period in the mid-1970s, the band experienced a revival during the late 1970s and early 1980s with their albums <i>Sleepwalker</i> (1977), <i>Misfits</i> (1978), <i>Low Budget</i> (1979), <i>Give the People What They Want</i> (1981) and <i>State of Confusion</i> (1983), the last of which produced one of the band's most successful US hits, ""Come Dancing"". In addition, groups such as Van Halen, the Jam, the Knack, the Pretenders and the Romantics covered their songs, helping to boost the Kinks' record sales. In the 1990s, Britpop acts such as Blur and Oasis cited the band as a major influence.</p><p>The original line-up comprised Ray Davies (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Dave Davies (lead guitar, vocals), Mick Avory (drums, percussion) and Pete Quaife (bass). The Davies brothers remained with the band throughout its history. Quaife was replaced by John Dalton in 1969, with keyboardist John Gosling being added in 1970 (prior to this, session keyboardist Nicky Hopkins played on many of their recordings). After Dalton's 1976 departure, Andy Pyle briefly served as the band's bassist before being replaced by Argent bassist Jim Rodford in 1978. Gosling quit in 1978 and was first replaced by ex-Pretty Things member Gordon Edwards, then more permanently by Ian Gibbons in 1979. Avory left the group in 1984 and was replaced by another Argent member Bob Henrit. The band gave its last public performance in 1996 and broke up in 1997 as a result of creative tension between the Davies brothers.</p><p>The Kinks have had five Top 10 singles on the US <i>Billboard</i> chart. Nine of their albums charted in the Top 40. In the UK, they have had seventeen Top 20 singles and five Top 10 albums. Four Kinks albums have been certified gold by the RIAA and the band have sold 50 million records worldwide. Among numerous honours, they received the Ivor Novello Award for ""Outstanding Service to British Music"". In 1990, the original four members of the Kinks were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, as well as the UK Music Hall of Fame in November 2005. In 2018, after years of ruling out a reunion due to the brothers' animosity and the difficult relationship between longtime drummer Mick Avory and Dave, Ray and Dave Davies finally announced they were working to reform the Kinks, with Avory also on board. However, comments made by each of the Davies brothers in 2020 and 2021 would indicate that in the years since the initial announcement, little (if any) progress has been made towards an actual Kinks reunion for a new studio band album.</p>"

</p><p>Beginning with a psychedelic sound with their debut LP <i>A Storm in Heaven</i>, by the mid-1990s the band had released several EPs and four albums. They also endured name and line-up changes, break-ups, health problems, drug abuse and various lawsuits. The band's commercial breakthrough was the 1997 album <i>Urban Hymns</i>, one of the best-selling albums in UK history. It features the hit singles ""Bitter Sweet Symphony"", ""The Drugs Don't Work"", ""Sonnet"" and ""Lucky Man"". In 1998, the band won two Brit Awards, winning Best British Group, appeared on the cover of <i>Rolling Stone</i> in March, and in February 1999, ""Bitter Sweet Symphony"" was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Rock Song.</p><p>Soon after their commercial peak, The Verve disbanded in April 1999, citing internal conflicts.

<p><b>The Pussycat Dolls</b> were an American girl group and dance ensemble, founded in Los Angeles, California, by choreographer Robin Antin in 1995 as a burlesque troupe. At the suggestion of Jimmy Iovine, Antin decided to take the burlesque troupe mainstream as a pop group. Antin negotiated a record deal with Interscope Geffen A&amp;M Records in 2003 turning the group into a music franchise comprising Nicole Scherzinger, Carmit Bachar, Ashley Roberts, Jessica Sutta, Melody Thornton, and Kimberly Wyatt. Their debut single, ""Sway"", was featured on the soundtrack of the 2004 film <i>Shall We Dance?</i>.
</p><p>The Pussycat Dolls achieved worldwide success with the singles ""Don't Cha"", ""Stickwitu"", ""Buttons"", and their multi-platinum debut album <i>PCD</i> (2005). However, despite their commercial success, the group was plagued by internal conflict due to the emphasis on Scherzinger, the group's lead vocalist, and the subordinate treatment of the other members. Bachar's departure from the group preceded the release of their second and final studio album <i>Doll Domination</i> (2008), which contains hit singles ""When I Grow Up"", ""I Hate This Part"", and ""Jai Ho! (You Are My Destiny)"". Following the completion of their 2009 world tour, the group went on hiatus and fully disbanded in 2010. The original recording line-up, minus Thornton, announced their reunion in 2019 with an upcoming tour and a new album. However, with the worsening situation arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, along with breaches of contracts and logistical issues, the reunion tour was cancelled in 2022, leaving the group's fate uncertain.
</p><p>The Pussycat Dolls brand diversified into merchandise, reality television programs, a Las Vegas act, product endorsements, spin-off recording groups (Girlicious, Paradiso Girls, G.R.L.), and other ventures. <i>Billboard</i> ranked the Pussycat Dolls as the 80th most successful musical act of the 2000s.

</p>
<p><b>The Velvet Underground</b> was an American rock band formed in New York City in 1964. The original line-up consisted of singer/guitarist Lou Reed, multi-instrumentalist John Cale, guitarist Sterling Morrison, and drummer Angus MacLise. MacLise was replaced by Moe Tucker in 1965, who played on most of the band's recordings. Their integration of rock and the avant-garde achieved little commercial success during the group's existence, but they are now recognized as one of the most influential bands in rock, underground, experimental, and alternative music. The group's provocative subject matter, musical experiments, and often nihilistic attitudes also proved influential in the development of punk rock and new wave music.</p><p>The group performed under several names before settling on the Velvet Underground in 1965, inspired by the book of the same name. In 1966, pop artist Andy Warhol became their manager, and they served as the house band at Warhol's studio, the Factory, and his traveling multimedia show, the <i>Exploding Plastic Inevitable</i>, from 1966 to 1967. Their debut album, <i>The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico</i> (with German singer and model Nico), was released in 1967 to critical indifference and poor sales but has since drawn wide acclaim. They released three more albums, <i>White Light/White Heat</i> (1968), <i>The Velvet Underground</i> (1969), and <i>Loaded</i> (1970), with Doug Yule replacing Cale for the final two, and with none performing up to the expectations of record labels or of Reed, the band's leader.
</p><p>The group functionally disbanded in the early 1970s as everyone except Yule left the band.  An abortive UK tour with Yule as the band leader and with new musicians followed in 1973, and a final album released in the band's name, <i>Squeeze</i> (1973), consisting mostly of Yule with a few session musicians, marked the end of the band for some time.  All of the members continued to collaborate on each other's solo work throughout the 1970s and 1980s, and a retrospective ""rarities"" album, <i>VU</i>, was released in 1985.  A full reunion of the band came in the early 1990s, with the Reed–Cale–Tucker–Morrison lineup playing a series of well-received shows in 1993, and releasing a live album from the tour, <i>Live MCMXCIII</i>.
</p><p>After Morrison's death in 1995, the remaining three members played together for a single performance at their Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction in 1996, the last time the band performed together musically. In 2004, the Velvet Underground were ranked number 19 on <i>Rolling Stone</i><span>'</span>s list of the ""100 Greatest Artists of All Time"". <i>The New York Times</i>  wrote that the Velvet Underground was ""arguably the most influential American rock band of our time"".</p>"

</p><p>Sumner and Hook formed the band after attending a June 1976 Sex Pistols concert. While Joy Division's first recordings were heavily influenced by early punk, they soon developed a sparse, melancholy style that made them one of the pioneers of the post-punk movement. Their self-released 1978 debut EP <i>An Ideal for Living</i> drew the attention of the Manchester television personality Tony Wilson, who signed them to his independent label Factory Records. Their debut album <i>Unknown Pleasures</i>, recorded with producer Martin Hannett, was released in 1979.
</p><p>Frontman Curtis struggled with personal problems including a failing marriage, depression, and epilepsy. As the band's popularity grew, Curtis's health condition made it increasingly difficult for him to perform; he occasionally experienced seizures on stage. He died by suicide on the eve of what would have been the band's first North American tour in May 1980, aged 23. Joy Division's second and final album, <i>Closer</i>, was released two months later; it and the single ""Love Will Tear Us Apart"" became their highest-charting releases.
</p><p>Between July and October 1980 the remaining members regrouped under the name New Order.

</p>
<p><b>Soundgarden</b> was an American rock band formed in Seattle, Washington, in 1984 by singer and drummer Chris Cornell, lead guitarist Kim Thayil (both of whom are the only members to appear in every incarnation of the band), and bassist Hiro Yamamoto; Cornell switched to rhythm guitar in 1985, replaced on drums initially by Scott Sundquist, and later by Matt Cameron in 1986. Yamamoto left in 1990 and was replaced initially by Jason Everman and shortly thereafter by Ben Shepherd. The band dissolved in 1997 and re-formed in 2010. Following Cornell's death in 2017 and a year of uncertainty regarding the band's future, Thayil declared in October 2018 that Soundgarden had disbanded once again, though they did reunite in January 2019 for a one-off concert in tribute to Cornell.</p><p>The band helped to popularize grunge music, a style of alternative rock that developed in the American Pacific Northwest in the mid-1980s, alongside such Seattle contemporaries as Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, and Nirvana. They were the first of a number of grunge bands to sign to the Seattle-based record label Sub Pop, through which they released EPs in both 1987 and 1988. California-based independent label SST Records released Soundgarden's debut album, <i>Ultramega OK</i>, which, although it did not sell well nationally, garnered critical acclaim and was nominated for a Grammy award in 1990. Their second album, <i>Louder Than Love</i>, was recorded independently, but, after they signed with A&amp;M Records in 1989 (making them one of the first grunge bands to sign to a major label), the album became their major-label debut. While <i>Ultramega OK</i> had failed to chart and <i>Louder Than Love</i> peaked at number 108 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 album chart, the band's third album, <i>Badmotorfinger</i>, buoyed by the success of the singles ""Jesus Christ Pose"", ""Outshined"", and ""Rusty Cage"", reached number 39 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 and has been certified double-platinum by the RIAA.
</p><p>Soundgarden achieved its biggest success with the 1994 album <i>Superunknown</i>, which debuted at number one on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 and yielded the Grammy Award-winning singles ""Spoonman"" and ""Black Hole Sun"". The band experimented with new sonic textures on their follow-up album <i>Down on the Upside</i>, which debuted at number 2 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 in 1996 and spawned several hit singles of its own, including ""Burden in My Hand"" and ""Blow Up the Outside World"". In 1997, the band broke up due to internal strife over its creative direction and exhaustion from touring. After more than a decade of working on projects and other bands, they reunited in 2010, and Republic Records released their sixth and final studio album, <i>King Animal</i>, two years later.
</p><p>As of 2019, Soundgarden had sold more than 14 million records in the United States, and an estimated 30 million worldwide. VH1 ranked Soundgarden at number 14 in their special <i>100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock</i>.</p>

</p>
<p><b>Cream</b> were  a British rock band formed in London in 1966. The group consisted of bassist Jack Bruce, guitarist Eric Clapton, and drummer Ginger Baker. Bruce was the primary songwriter and vocalist, although Clapton and Baker contributed to songs. Formed by members of previously successful bands, they are widely regarded as the first supergroup. Cream were highly regarded for the instrumental proficiency of each of their members. 
</p><p>During their brief three-year career, the band released four albums, <i>Fresh Cream</i> (1966), <i>Disraeli Gears</i> (1967), <i>Wheels of Fire</i> (1968), and <i>Goodbye</i> (1969). Beginning with <i>Disraeli Gears</i>, the band was joined in the studio by producer and multi-instrumentalist Felix Pappalardi, who became an important influence on the band's sound. Cream's music spanned many genres of rock music, including blues rock (""Crossroads"", ""Born Under a Bad Sign""), psychedelic rock (""Tales of Brave Ulysses"", ""White Room""), and hard rock (""Sunshine of Your Love"", ""SWLABR""). Throughout their career, they sold more than 15 million records worldwide. The group's third album, <i>Wheels of Fire</i> (1968), is the first platinum-selling double album.</p><p>Tensions between Bruce and Baker led to their decision in May 1968 to break up, though the band were persuaded to make a final album, <i>Goodbye</i>, and to tour, culminating in two final farewell concerts at the Royal Albert Hall on 25 and 26 November 1968 which were filmed and shown in theatres, then in 1977 released as a home video, <i>Farewell Concert</i>.
</p><p>In 1993, Cream were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. They were included in both <i>Rolling Stone</i> and VH1's lists of the ""100 Greatest Artists of All Time"", at number 67 and 61 respectively. They were also ranked number 16 on VH1's ""100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock"".</p>"

Ludwig van Beethoven,,,Ludwig van Beethoven,"<p class=""mw-empty-elt"">


</p>
<p><b>Ludwig van Beethoven</b> (baptised 17 December 1770 – 26 March 1827) was a German composer and pianist. Beethoven remains one of the most admired composers in the history of Western music; his works rank amongst the most performed of the classical music repertoire and span the transition from the Classical period to the Romantic era in classical music. His career has conventionally been divided into early, middle, and late periods. His early period, during which he forged his craft, is typically considered to have lasted until 1802. From 1802 to around 1812, his middle period showed an individual development from the styles of Joseph Haydn and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and is sometimes characterized as heroic. During this time, he began to grow increasingly deaf. In his late period, from 1812 to 1827, he extended his innovations in musical form and expression.
</p><p>Beethoven was born in Bonn. His musical talent was obvious at an early age. He was initially harshly and intensively taught by his father Johann van Beethoven. Beethoven was later taught by the composer and conductor Christian Gottlob Neefe, under whose tutelage he published his first work, a set of keyboard variations, in 1783. He found relief from a dysfunctional home life with the family of Helene von Breuning, whose children he loved, befriended, and taught piano. At age 21, he moved to Vienna, which subsequently became his base, and studied composition with Haydn. Beethoven then gained a reputation as a virtuoso pianist, and he was soon patronized by Karl Alois, Prince Lichnowsky for compositions, which resulted in his three Opus 1 piano trios (the earliest works to which he accorded an opus number) in 1795.
</p><p>His first major orchestral work, the First Symphony, premiered in 1800, and his first set of string quartets was published in 1801. Despite his hearing deteriorating during this period, he continued to conduct, premiering his Third and Fifth Symphonies in 1804 and 1808, respectively. His Violin Concerto appeared in 1806. His last piano concerto (No. 5, Op. 73, known as the <i>Emperor</i>), dedicated to his frequent patron Archduke Rudolf of Austria, was premiered in 1811, without Beethoven as soloist. He was almost completely deaf by 1814, and he then gave up performing and appearing in public. He described his problems with health and his unfulfilled personal life in two letters, his Heiligenstadt Testament (1802) to his brothers and his unsent love letter to an unknown ""Immortal Beloved"" (1812).
</p><p>After 1810, increasingly less socially involved, Beethoven composed many of his most admired works, including later symphonies, mature chamber music and the late piano sonatas. His only opera, <i>Fidelio</i>, first performed in 1805, was revised to its final version in 1814. He composed <i>Missa solemnis</i> between 1819 and 1823 and his final Symphony, No. 9, one of the first examples of a choral symphony, between 1822 and 1824. Written in his last years, his late string quartets, including the <i>Grosse Fuge</i>, of 1825–1826 are among his final achievements. After some months of bedridden illness, he died in 1827. Beethoven's works remain mainstays of the classical music repertoire.

</p>
<p><b>Ramones</b> were an American punk rock band that formed in the New York City neighborhood of Forest Hills, Queens, in 1974. They are often cited as the first true punk rock group. Despite achieving a limited commercial appeal in the United States during their time together, the band saw more success in England, Argentina and Brazil, and are today seen as highly influential.
</p><p>All of the band members adopted pseudonyms ending with the surname ""Ramone"", although none of them were biologically related; they were inspired by Paul McCartney, who would check into hotels as ""Paul Ramon"". The Ramones performed 2,263 concerts, touring virtually nonstop for 22 years. In 1996, after a tour with the Lollapalooza music festival, they played a farewell concert in Los Angeles and disbanded. By 2014, all four of the band's original members had died – lead singer Joey Ramone (1951–2001), bassist Dee Dee Ramone (1951–2002), guitarist Johnny Ramone (1948–2004) and drummer Tommy Ramone (1949–2014). The remaining surviving members of the Ramones—bassist C. J. Ramone (who replaced Dee Dee in 1989 and stayed with the band until its dissolution) and drummers Marky Ramone, Richie Ramone and Elvis Ramone—are still musically active.
</p><p>Recognition of the band's importance built over the years.

The members regrouped after the disbandment of their previous band Joy Division due to the suicide of lead singer Ian Curtis. They were joined by Gillian Gilbert on keyboards later that year. New Order's integration of post-punk with electronic and dance music made them one of the most acclaimed and influential bands of the 1980s. They were the flagship band for Manchester-based independent record label Factory Records and its nightclub The Haçienda, and they worked in long-term collaboration with graphic designer Peter Saville.</p><p>While the band's early years were overshadowed by the legacy of Joy Division, their experience of the early 1980s New York club scene saw them increasingly incorporate dance rhythms and electronic instrumentation into their work. Their 1983 hit ""Blue Monday"" became the best-selling 12-inch single of all time and a popular club track. In the 1980s, they released successful albums such as <i>Power, Corruption &amp; Lies</i> (1983), <i>Technique</i> (1989), and the singles compilation <i>Substance</i> (1987). They disbanded in 1993 to work on individual projects before reuniting in 1998. In the years since then New Order has gone through various hiatuses and personnel changes, most prominently the departure of Hook in 2007 due to personal disputes with the other members.  In 2015 they released their tenth studio album, <i>Music Complete</i>.  In 2023, both Joy Division and New Order were nominated as one act for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.</p>"

The band's lineup—consisting of lead vocalist Till Lindemann, lead guitarist Richard Kruspe, rhythm guitarist Paul Landers, bassist Oliver Riedel, drummer Christoph Schneider, and keyboardist Christian ""Flake"" Lorenz—has remained unchanged throughout their history, along with their approach to songwriting, which consists of Lindemann writing and singing the lyrics over instrumental pieces the rest of the band has completed beforehand. Prior to their formation, some members were associated with the punk rock acts Feeling B and First Arsch.
</p><p>After winning a local contest, Rammstein was able to record demos and send them to different record labels, eventually signing with Motor Music. Working with producer Jacob Hellner, they released their debut album <i>Herzeleid</i> in 1995. Though the album initially sold poorly, the band gained popularity through their live performances and the album eventually reached No. 6 in Germany. Their second album, <i>Sehnsucht</i>, was released in 1997 and debuted at No. 1 in Germany, resulting in a worldwide tour lasting nearly four years and spawning the successful singles ""Engel"" and ""Du hast"" and the live album <i>Live aus Berlin</i> (1999). Following the tour, Rammstein signed with major label Universal Music and released <i>Mutter</i> in 2001. Six singles were released from the album, all charting in countries throughout Europe. The lead single, ""Sonne"", reached No. 2 in Germany. Rammstein released <i>Reise, Reise</i> in 2004 and had two more singles reach No. 2 in Germany: ""Mein Teil"" and ""Amerika""; the former song reached No. 1 in Spain, becoming their first No. 1 single.
</p><p>Their fifth album, <i>Rosenrot</i>, was released in 2005, and the lead single, ""Benzin"", reached No. 6 in Germany. Their second live album, <i>Völkerball</i>, was released in 2006. The band released their sixth album, <i>Liebe ist für alle da</i>, in 2009, with its lead single, ""Pussy"", becoming their first No. 1 hit in Germany despite having a controversial music video that featured hardcore pornography. The band then entered a recording hiatus and toured for several years, releasing the <i>Made in Germany</i> greatest hits album as well as the <i>Rammstein in Amerika</i> and <i>Paris</i> live albums. After a decade without new music, Rammstein returned in 2019 with the song ""Deutschland"", which became their second No. 1 hit in Germany. Their untitled seventh studio album was released in May 2019 and reached No. 1 in 14 countries. While sheltering during COVID-19 lockdowns, the band spontaneously wrote and recorded their eighth studio album, <i>Zeit</i>, which was released in April 2022.
</p><p>Rammstein was one of the first bands to emerge within the Neue Deutsche Härte genre, with their debut album leading the music press to coin the term, and their style of music has generally had a positive reception from music critics. Commercially, the band has been very successful, earning many No. 1 albums as well as gold and platinum certifications in countries around the world. Their grand live performances, which often feature pyrotechnics, have contributed to the growth in their popularity. Despite success, the band has been subject to some controversies, with their overall image having been criticized; for instance, the song ""Ich tu dir weh"" forced its parent album <i>Liebe ist für alle da</i> to be re-released in Germany with the song removed due to its sexually explicit lyrics.

<p><b>Van Halen</b> (<span></span> <i title=""English pronunciation respelling"">van <span>HAY</span>-len</i>) was an American rock band formed in Pasadena, California, in 1972. Credited with ""restoring hard rock to the forefront of the music scene"", Van Halen was known for its energetic live shows and for the virtuosity of its lead guitarist, Eddie Van Halen. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2007.
</p><p>From 1974 until 1985, Van Halen consisted of Eddie Van Halen; Eddie's brother, drummer Alex Van Halen; vocalist David Lee Roth; and bassist/vocalist Michael Anthony. Upon its release in 1978, the band's self-titled debut album reached No. 19 on the <i>Billboard</i> pop music charts and would sell over 10 million copies in the U.S. By 1982, the band released four more albums (<i>Van Halen II</i>, <i>Women and Children First</i>, <i>Fair Warning</i>, and <i>Diver Down</i>), all of which have since been certified multi-platinum. By the early 1980s, Van Halen was one of the most successful rock acts of the day. The album <i>1984</i> was a commercial success with U.S. sales of 10 million copies and four hit singles; its lead single, ""Jump"", was the band's only U.S. number one single.
</p><p>In 1985, Roth left the band to embark on a solo career and was replaced by former Montrose lead vocalist Sammy Hagar. With Hagar, the group released four U.S. number-one, multi-platinum albums over the course of 11 years (<i>5150</i> in 1986, <i>OU812</i> in 1988, <i>For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge</i> in 1991, and <i>Balance</i> in 1995). Hagar left the band in 1996 shortly before the release of the band's first greatest hits collection, <i>Best Of – Volume I</i>. Former Extreme frontman Gary Cherone replaced Hagar and recorded the commercially unsuccessful album <i>Van Halen III</i> with the band in 1998, before parting ways in 1999. Van Halen then went on hiatus until reuniting with Hagar in 2003 for a worldwide tour in 2004 and the double-disc greatest hits collection <i>The Best of Both Worlds</i>. Hagar again left Van Halen in 2005. In 2006 Roth returned, but Anthony was replaced on bass guitar by Eddie's son, Wolfgang Van Halen. In 2012, the band released their final studio album <i>A Different Kind of Truth</i>, which was commercially and critically successful; it was also Van Halen's first album with Roth in 28 years and the only one to feature Wolfgang.
</p><p>As of March 2019, Van Halen is 20th on the RIAA list of best-selling artists in the United States; the band has sold 56 million albums in the States and more than 80 million worldwide, making them one of the best-selling groups of all time. As of 2007, Van Halen is one of only five rock bands with two studio albums to sell more than 10 million copies in the United States and is tied for the most multi-platinum albums by an American band. Additionally, Van Halen has charted 13 number-one hits on <i>Billboard</i><span>'</span>s Mainstream Rock chart. VH1 ranked the band seventh on a list of the top 100 Hard Rock artists of all time.</p><p>Eddie was diagnosed with cancer in 2001, and died of the disease on October 6, 2020. A month after his father's death, Wolfgang confirmed that Van Halen had disbanded.</p>

</p>
<p><b>Sublime</b> was an American ska punk band from Long Beach, California, formed in 1988. The band's line-up, consistent throughout its duration, consisted of Bradley Nowell (vocals and guitar), Eric Wilson (bass), and Bud Gaugh (drums). Lou Dog, Nowell's dalmatian, was the mascot of the band. Nowell died of a heroin overdose in 1996, resulting in the band's breakup. In 1997, songs such as ""What I Got"", ""Santeria"", ""Wrong Way"", ""Doin' Time"", and ""April 29, 1992 (Miami)"" were released to U.S. radio.</p><p>Sublime released three studio albums, one live album, five compilation albums (one of which also contains never-before released material), three EPs, and one box set. Although their first two albums—<i>40oz. to Freedom</i> (1992) and <i>Robbin' the Hood</i> (1994)—were slightly popular in the United States, Sublime did not experience major commercial success until 1996 with their self-titled third album, released two months after Nowell's death, which peaked at No. 13 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200, and spawned the single ""What I Got"", which remains the band's only No. 1 hit single (on the <i>Billboard</i> Alternative Songs chart) in their musical career. As of 2022, the band has sold over 20 million albums worldwide, including about ten million in the U.S. alone. Michael ""Miguel"" Happoldt and Marshall ""Ras MG"" Goodman contributed to several Sublime songs.
</p><p>In 2009, the surviving members attempted to reform the band with Rome Ramirez, a young guitarist and avowed Sublime fan from California. However, not long after performing at Cypress Hill's Smokeout Festival, a Los Angeles judge banned the new lineup from using the Sublime name as they needed permission from Nowell's estate, which owns the rights to the Sublime name. This prompted the lineup of Wilson, Gaugh and Ramirez to change their name to Sublime with Rome, which has since released three albums, although Gaugh left the group shortly after the release of their 2011 debut <i>Yours Truly</i>.

</p>
<p><b>Deftones</b> is an American alternative metal band formed in Sacramento, California in 1988. They were formed by Chino Moreno (vocals, guitar), Stephen Carpenter (guitar), Abe Cunningham (drums), and Dominic Garcia (bass). During their first five years, the band's lineup changed several times, but stabilized in 1993 when Cunningham rejoined after his departure in 1990; by this time, Chi Cheng was bassist. The lineup remained stable for fifteen years, with the exception of keyboardist and turntablist Frank Delgado being added in 1999. The band’s experimental nature has led some critics to describe them as ""the Radiohead of metal"".</p><p>Deftones have released nine albums since their inception. After the lineup settled in 1993, the band secured a recording contract with Maverick Records, and subsequently released their debut album <i>Adrenaline</i> in 1995. Promoting the album by touring exhaustively with other bands in the scene, Deftones managed to gain a dedicated fan base through word of mouth. Their second album <i>Around the Fur</i> was released in 1997, reached chart positions along with its singles, and became the band's first to receive certification from the RIAA. The band found even further success with their third album <i>White Pony</i> (2000), which saw a transition away from their earlier, more aggressive sound into a more experimental direction. Its lead single ""Change (In the House of Flies)"" is the band's most commercially successful single, and the track ""Elite"" won a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance; it was also the band's first of three albums to be certified platinum in the United States. Their self-titled fourth album was released in 2003. While the group's critical success continued, sales proved to be lackluster compared to <i>White Pony</i>.
</p><p>Deftones' fifth studio effort, <i>Saturday Night Wrist</i>, was released in 2006. While critically acclaimed, the album’s production was marred by creative tensions and personal issues within the band, some of which influenced its material. In 2008, while Deftones were working on an album tentatively titled <i>Eros</i>, Cheng was involved in a traffic collision. As a result, he was left in a minimally conscious state until his death in 2013 of cardiac arrest. After Cheng's accident, Deftones halted production on <i>Eros</i>. Quicksand bassist Sergio Vega, who had filled in as a touring member to replace Cheng, later became his permanent replacement, though Vega alleges he was never an official member.
</p><p>The band released the critically celebrated <i>Diamond Eyes</i> in 2010 and embarked on a triple-headline tour with Alice in Chains and Mastodon throughout North America. Their seventh and eighth albums, <i>Koi No Yokan</i> (2012) and  <i>Gore</i> (2016) respectively, saw the band continue to move in an increasingly experimental direction and were released to critical acclaim. Their latest album, <i>Ohms</i>, was released on September 25, 2020, receiving significant critical praise for its return to the band's heavier sound. In March 2022, it was announced that bassist Sergio Vega had left the band in early 2021. They have sold more than 10 million albums worldwide.</p>"

</p>
<p><b>Tenacious D</b> is an American comedy rock duo formed in Los Angeles, California in 1994. It was founded by actors Jack Black and Kyle Gass, who were members of The Actors' Gang theater company at the time. The duo's name is derived from ""tenacious defense"", a phrase used by NBA basketball sportscasters Walt Frazier and Marv Albert.</p><p>Prior to the release of Tenacious D's 2001 debut album <i>Tenacious D</i>, the duo had a three-episode TV series released on HBO, with the episodes broadcasting between 1997 and 2000. This series came about after the band had met David Cross on the Los Angeles music scene—and Black featuring in episodes of <i>Mr. Show with Bob and David</i>. The band also befriended former Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl, which began a working relationship between Foo Fighters and Tenacious D. Towards the end of the 1990s, the duo supported large rock acts such as Weezer, Pearl Jam, Tool, and Beck.</p><p>In 2000, they signed with Epic Records and the year after released <i>Tenacious D,</i> their debut album featuring a full band, including Grohl on the drums. Their first single, ""Tribute"", has achieved cult status since its release, contributing to their popularity in the United Kingdom, Sweden, Ireland and Australia. In 2003, the band released <i>The Complete Master Works</i>, their first live concert DVD which achieved gold and platinum status by the RIAA.</p><p>In November 2006, they starred in their own film, <i>Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny,</i> released by New Line Cinema, with Epic Records releasing the soundtrack as their second album, <i>The Pick of Destiny.</i> The film cost $20 million to produce, though only grossed $13.9 million at the box office and suffered mixed reviews from critics. Despite the poor reception of the actual film, the band would near sell-out arenas on its respective tour, including Madison Square Garden in New York. Following several years of sporadic festival dates and special appearances, the band released their third album <i>Rize of the Fenix</i> on May 15, 2012, through Columbia Records, with the album making light of <i>The Pick of Destiny's</i> commercial failure.</p><p>In 2013, the band hosted the comedy music festival Festival Supreme in Los Angeles, which would go on to host three more editions. In 2014, the band were invited to feature on <i>Ronnie James Dio – This Is Your Life</i>, a compilation album where various artists cover Ronnie James Dio songs to raise funds for cancer. Their cover of ""The Last in Line"" won a Grammy for best heavy metal performance at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards. Following teases from Black and Gass regarding a second film, in late 2018, the band began independently releasing an animatic hand-drawn web series titled, <i>Tenacious D in Post-Apocalypto</i>, each of the six episodes uploading exclusively to YouTube every week starting September 28. Columbia Records released the album <i>Post-Apocalypto</i> on November 2, 2018, just after the release of the sixth episode.</p><p>Tenacious D's music showcases Black's theatrical vocal delivery and Gass's acoustic guitar-playing abilities. Critics have described their fusion of vulgar absurdist comedy with rock music as ""mock rock"". Their songs discuss the duo's purported musical and sexual prowess, as well as their friendship and cannabis usage in a style that music critics have compared with the storyteller-style lyrics of rock opera.</p>

In late 2014, Ilejay left the band, and was replaced by former Bad Religion drummer Brooks Wackerman, but the lineup change was not announced to the public until 2015. The band then surprise-released their seventh studio album titled <i>The Stage</i> on October 28, 2016, which debuted as number 4 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 chart in the US. <i>The Stage</i> is their first conceptual album and it marked another stylistic change for the band, moving towards a progressive metal sound.

After Roth's departure in 1978, Schenker and Meine took control of the group, giving them almost all the power to compose music and write lyrics. Matthias Jabs joined in 1978, and with the melodic rock he played and the influence of producer Dieter Dierks in the band, the Scorpions changed their sound to melodic heavy metal mixed with lyrical ""power rock ballads"", which is evident in the album <i>Lovedrive</i> (1979), which began the evolution of the band's sound, with recording a developed later in several of their albums.

Two of the songs on their ninth studio album <i>Love at First Sting</i>, ""Rock You Like a Hurricane"" and ""Still Loving You"", are regarded as some of the most influential and popular works, both in heavy metal music and among rock ballads, defined as ""rock anthem"" and ""a true hymn of love"".</p>"

</p>
<p><b>Kiss</b> (stylized as <b>KI<i>ϟϟ</i></b>) is an American rock band formed in New York City in 1973 originally composed by Paul Stanley (vocals, rhythm guitar), Gene Simmons (vocals, bass), Ace Frehley (lead guitar, vocals), and Peter Criss (drums, vocals). Known for their face paint and stage outfits, the group rose to prominence in the mid-1970s with shock rock-style live performances, which featured fire-breathing, blood-spitting, smoking guitars, shooting rockets, levitating drum kits, and pyrotechnics. The band has gone through several lineup changes, with Stanley and Simmons remaining the only consistent members. The current lineup consists of Stanley, Simmons, guitarist Tommy Thayer and drummer Eric Singer.
</p><p>With their makeup and costumes, the band members took on the personae of comic book-style characters: the Starchild (Stanley), the Demon (Simmons), the Spaceman or Space Ace (Frehley), and the Catman (Criss). Due to creative differences, Criss departed the band in 1980 and Frehley in 1982, though both would return later.
</p><p>In 1983, Kiss began performing without makeup and costumes, marking the beginning of the band's ""unmasked"" era that would last for over a decade. The band experienced a commercial resurgence during this era, with the 1983 platinum-certified album <i>Lick It Up</i> successfully introducing them to a new generation of fans, and its music videos receiving regular airplay on MTV. Eric Carr, who had replaced Criss in 1980, died in 1991 of heart cancer and was replaced by Eric Singer. In response to a wave of Kiss nostalgia in the mid-1990s, the original lineup reunited in 1996, which also saw the return of its makeup and stage costumes. The resulting reunion tour was highly successful, grossing $143.7 million, making it the band's most successful tour to date. Criss and Frehley subsequently left the band again, and have been replaced by Singer and Tommy Thayer, respectively. The band has continued with its original stage makeup, with Singer and Thayer using the original Catman and Spaceman makeup, respectively. In September 2018, Kiss announced that, after 45 years of recording and performing, it would embark on its final tour, the End of the Road World Tour, which started in January 2019 and is currently set to conclude in 2023.</p><p>Kiss is regarded as one of the most influential rock bands of all time, as well as one of the best selling bands of all time, claiming to have sold more than 100 million records worldwide, including 21 million RIAA-certified albums. Kiss has also earned 30 Gold albums, the most of any band from the United States. Kiss has 14 Platinum albums, three of which earned multi-Platinum. On April 10, 2014, the four original members of Kiss were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Kiss was ranked by MTV as the ninth ""Greatest Metal Band of All Time"", and placed tenth on VH1's ""100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock"" list, as well as being ranked as the third ""Best Metal and Hard Rock Live Band of All Time"" by <i>Loudwire</i> magazine.</p>"

Jim O'Rourke (bass, keyboards, guitar) was also a member of the band from 1999 to 2005, and Mark Ibold (bass, guitar) was a member from 2006 to 2011.
</p><p>Sonic Youth emerged from the experimental no wave art and music scene in New York before evolving into a more conventional rock band and becoming a prominent member of the American noise rock scene. Sonic Youth have been praised for having ""redefined what rock guitar could do"" using a wide variety of unorthodox guitar tunings while preparing guitars with objects like drum sticks and screwdrivers to alter the instruments' timbre. The band was a pivotal influence on the alternative and indie rock movements.
</p><p>After gaining a large underground following and critical praise through releases with SST Records in the late 1980s, the band experienced mainstream success throughout the 1990s and 2000s after signing to major label DGC in 1990 and headlining the 1995 Lollapalooza festival.

In 1985, Talking Heads released their best-selling album, <i>Little Creatures</i>. They produced a soundtrack album for Byrne's film <i>True Stories</i> (1986), and released their final album, worldbeat-influenced <i>Naked</i> (1988), before disbanding in 1991.

Innovators of the music video, Duran Duran were catapulted into the mainstream with the introduction of the 24-hour music channel MTV. The group was a leading band in the MTV-driven Second British Invasion of the US in the 1980s. Photographer Denis O'Regan, who captured the band during their 1984 tour, commented ""Duran Duran in America was like Beatlemania.""</p><p>The band's first major hit was ""Girls on Film"" (1981), from their self-titled debut album, the popularity of which was enhanced by a controversial music video. A heavily edited form played in rotation on MTV. The band's breakthrough second album was <i>Rio</i> (1982), which peaked at number six in the US, number two in the United Kingdom, and number one in Australia and Canada. The songs ""Hungry Like the Wolf"" and ""Rio"" featured cinematic music videos directed by Australian film maker Russel Mulcahy and became two of their biggest hits.

The band reformed in 2017 to record a fourth album, <i>Eat the Elephant</i>, which was released on April 20, 2018.
</p><p>Prone to downtime due to Keenan's other musical commitments, the band has featured a variety of musicians throughout alternating periods of activity and inactivity, and has changed line-ups on each album, leaving Keenan and Howerdel the only constant members. The original incarnation of the band included Paz Lenchantin on bass, Troy Van Leeuwen on guitar, and Josh Freese on drums. Primus drummer Tim Alexander had briefly stood in as a drummer prior to Freese in the band's initial live shows; however, this was prior to releasing any material. Band collaborator and producer Danny Lohner and Marilyn Manson bassist Jeordie White were also members for a short period in the early 2000s. The band's current lineup features Smashing Pumpkins guitarist James Iha, bassist Matt McJunkins, and drummer Jeff Friedl, the latter two also being contributors to the related Puscifer and Ashes Divide projects. Despite the varied cast and numerous lineup changes, the stylistic content of A Perfect Circle's songs has remained consistent with Howerdel as music composer, and Keenan writing lyrics and vocal melodies. The band's studio albums have been generally well received critically and commercially, with their first three studio albums selling 4 million copies collectively as of 2005.</p>

</p>
<p><b>Pantera</b> (<span></span>) is an American heavy metal band from Arlington, Texas, formed in 1981, and currently composed of vocalist Phil Anselmo, bassist Rex Brown, and touring musicians Zakk Wylde and Charlie Benante. The group's best-known lineup consisted of the Abbott brothers (drummer Vinnie Paul and guitarist Dimebag Darrell), along with Brown and Anselmo, who joined in 1982 and 1986 respectively. In addition to their development and popularization of the groove metal subgenre, Pantera is credited (along with others, such as Testament, Sepultura, and Machine Head) for being part of the second wave of thrash metal scene from the late 1980s to early-to-mid 1990s. Pantera is regarded as one of the most successful and influential bands in heavy metal history, having sold around 20 million records worldwide and having received four Grammy nominations.</p><p>Having started as a glam metal band, Pantera released three albums in the mid-1980s with lead vocalist Terry Glaze (<i>Metal Magic</i>, <i>Projects in the Jungle</i>, and <i>I Am the Night</i>), with little success. Looking for a new and heavier sound, Pantera recruited Anselmo in 1986 and released <i>Power Metal</i> in 1988. They secured a record deal with major label Atco the following year. Their fifth album (which the band has since declared to be their official debut album), 1990's <i>Cowboys from Hell</i>, popularized the groove metal genre, while its 1992 follow-up <i>Vulgar Display of Power</i> achieved an even heavier sound and increased their popularity. The subsequent album <i>Far Beyond Driven</i> (1994) then debuted at number one on the <i>Billboard</i> 200.</p><p>Tensions began to surface among the band members when Anselmo, reeling from severe back problems brought on by years of intense on-stage performances, began growing distant from his bandmates in 1995, eventually becoming addicted to heroin as a result of his pain issues (he almost died from an overdose in July 1996). These tensions resulted in the recording sessions for <i>The Great Southern Trendkill</i> (1996) being held separately. The ongoing tension lasted for another seven years, during which only one studio album, <i>Reinventing the Steel</i> (2000), was recorded. Pantera went on hiatus in 2001 but lingering disputes led to the band breaking up in 2003. The Abbott brothers went on to form Damageplan while Anselmo continued to work on several side projects, including Down, which Brown joined as well.
</p><p>On December 8, 2004, Dimebag Darrell was shot and killed on stage by a mentally unstable fan during a Damageplan concert in Columbus, Ohio. Vinnie Paul went on to form Hellyeah after his brother's death, and died of heart failure in 2018, leaving Brown and Anselmo as the only surviving members of the band's best-known lineup. In July 2022, it was announced that Brown and Anselmo were reuniting in 2023 for Pantera's first tour in 22 years, with Zakk Wylde and Charlie Benante filling in for the Abbott brothers on guitar and drums, respectively. The new lineup played its first show in 21 years at the Hell and Heaven festival in Mexico on December 2, 2022, and the band's reunion tour will continue into 2024.</p>"

<p><b>Stone Temple Pilots</b> (also known by the acronym <b>STP</b>) is an American rock band from San Diego, California, that originally consisted of Scott Weiland (lead vocals), brothers Dean (guitar) and Robert DeLeo (bass, backing vocals), and Eric Kretz (drums). The band's lineup remained unchanged from its formation in 1989 until the firing of Weiland in February 2013. Linkin Park vocalist Chester Bennington joined the band in May 2013 but left amicably in November 2015. In 2016, the band launched an online audition for a new lead vocalist; they announced Jeff Gutt as the new lead singer on November 14, 2017.
</p><p>After forming in 1989 under the name Mighty Joe Young, the band signed with Atlantic Records and changed its name to Stone Temple Pilots.

STP released four more studio albums: <i>Purple</i> (1994), <i>Tiny Music... Songs from the Vatican Gift Shop</i> (1996), <i>No. 4</i> (1999), and <i>Shangri-La Dee Da</i> (2001), before separating in 2003, after which the band members partook in various projects (most notably Velvet Revolver and Army of Anyone). STP eventually reconvened in 2008 for a reunion tour, released their self-titled sixth album in 2010, and actively toured until Chester Bennington's departure. The band's only material with Bennington was the EP <i>High Rise</i>, in 2013. STP has released two albums with Gutt on vocals: its second self-titled album, on March 16, 2018 and eighth studio album, <i>Perdida</i>, on February 7, 2020.</p><p>While initially rising to fame as part of the grunge movement of the early 1990s, further releases from the band expressed a variety of influences, including psychedelic rock, bossa nova, and classic rock. STP's evolution throughout the 1990s and early 2000s involved periods of commercial highs and lows, brought about in part by Weiland's well-publicized struggles with drug addiction.

<p><b>Motörhead</b> (<span></span>) were  an English rock band formed in London in 1975 by Lemmy (lead vocals, bass), Larry Wallis (guitar) and Lucas Fox (drums). Lemmy was also the primary songwriter and only constant member. The band are often considered a precursor to the new wave of British heavy metal, which re-energised heavy metal in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Though several guitarists and drummers have played in Motörhead, most of their best-selling albums and singles feature drummer Phil ""Philthy Animal"" Taylor and guitarist ""Fast"" Eddie Clarke.
</p><p>Motörhead released 23 studio albums, 10 live recordings, 12 compilation albums and five EPs over a career spanning 40 years. Usually a power trio, they had particular success in the early 1980s with several successful singles in the UK Top 40 chart. The albums <i>Overkill</i>, <i>Bomber</i>, <i>Ace of Spades</i> and, particularly, the live album <i>No Sleep 'til Hammersmith</i> cemented Motörhead's reputation as a top-tier rock band. The band are ranked number 26 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock. As of 2016, they have sold more than 15 million albums worldwide.</p><p>Most often classified as heavy metal, Motörhead has been credited with being part of and influencing numerous musical scenes, thrash metal and speed metal especially. Lemmy, however, always insisted that they were a rock and roll band. He said that they had more in common with punk bands, but with their own unique sound, Motörhead is embraced in both punk and metal scenes. Their lyrics typically covered such topics as war, good versus evil, abuse of power, promiscuous sex, substance abuse and, most famously, gambling, the last theme being the focus of their hit song ""Ace of Spades"".</p><p>Lemmy died on 28 December 2015 from cardiac arrhythmia and congestive heart failure, after being diagnosed with prostate cancer. The day after his death, drummer Mikkey Dee and guitarist Phil Campbell both confirmed that Motörhead had disbanded. By 2018, all three members of Motörhead's best-known line-up (Lemmy, Taylor and Clarke) had died.</p>

</p>
<p>The <b>Electric Light Orchestra</b> (<b>ELO</b>) are  an English rock band formed in Birmingham in 1970 by songwriters and multi-instrumentalists Jeff Lynne and Roy Wood with drummer Bev Bevan. Their music is characterised by a fusion of pop, classical arrangements and futuristic iconography. After Wood's departure in 1972, Lynne became the band's sole leader, arranging and producing every album while writing nearly all of their original material. For their initial tenure, Lynne, Bevan and keyboardist Richard Tandy were the group's only consistent members.
</p><p>ELO was formed out of Lynne's and Wood's desire to create modern rock and pop songs with classical overtones. It derived as an offshoot of Wood's previous band, the Move, of which Lynne and Bevan were also members. During the 1970s and 1980s, ELO released a string of top 10 albums and singles, including the band's most commercially successful album, the double album <i>Out of the Blue</i> (1977). Two ELO albums reached the top of British charts: the disco-inspired <i>Discovery</i> (1979) and the science-fiction-themed concept album <i>Time</i> (1981). In 1986 Lynne lost interest in the band and disbanded the group. Bevan responded by forming his own band, ELO Part II, which later became the Orchestra. Apart from a brief reunion in the early 2000s, ELO remained largely inactive until 2014, when Lynne re-formed the band with Tandy as <b>Jeff Lynne's ELO</b>.</p><p>During ELO's original 13-year period of active recording and touring, they sold over 50 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling music groups of all time.

The trio were especially successful in popular music in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and later as prominent performers in the disco music era in the mid- to late 1970s. The group sang recognisable three-part tight harmonies: Robin's clear vibrato lead vocals were a hallmark of their earlier hits, while Barry's R&amp;B falsetto became their signature sound during the mid- to late 1970s and 1980s. The group wrote all their own original material, as well as writing and producing several major hits for other artists, and are regarded as one of the most important and influential acts in pop-music history. They have been referred to in the media as The Disco Kings, Britain's First Family of Harmony, and The Kings of Dance Music.</p><p>Born on the Isle of Man to English parents, the Gibb brothers lived in Chorlton, Manchester, England, until the late 1950s. There, in 1955, they formed the skiffle/rock and roll group the Rattlesnakes. The family then moved to Redcliffe, in the Moreton Bay Region, Queensland, Australia, later to Cribb Island.  After achieving their first chart success in Australia as the Bee Gees with ""Spicks and Specks"" (their twelfth single), they returned to the UK in January 1967, when producer Robert Stigwood began promoting them to a worldwide audience. The Bee Gees' <i>Saturday Night Fever</i> soundtrack (1977) was the turning point of their career, with both the film and soundtrack having a cultural impact throughout the world, enhancing the disco scene's mainstream appeal. They won five Grammy Awards for <i>Saturday Night Fever</i>, including Album of the Year.

</p><p>After gaining additional acclaim with the release of their tenth album <i>Recycler</i> (1990), and its accompanying tour, the group's experimentation continued with mixed success on the albums <i>Antenna</i> (1994), <i>Rhythmeen</i> (1996), <i>XXX</i> (1999), and <i>Mescalero</i> (2003).

Despite an innovative and pioneering body of work in the latter half of the 1970s, the band had struggled with indifferent record production and a lack of major commercial success until 1980, when they rose to commercial success with the album <i>British Steel</i>.
</p><p>The band's membership has seen much turnover, including a revolving cast of drummers in the 1970s and the departure of singer Rob Halford in 1992.

The current line-up consists of Halford, guitarists Glenn Tipton and Richie Faulkner, bassist Ian Hill and drummer Scott Travis. The band's best-selling album is 1982's <i>Screaming for Vengeance</i>, with their most commercially successful line-up featuring Hill, Halford, Tipton, guitarist K. K. Downing, and drummer Dave Holland. Although not original members, Tipton and Hill are the only two of the band to appear on every album.
</p><p>Halford's operatic vocal style and the twin guitar sound of Downing and Tipton have been a major influence on heavy metal bands. Judas Priest's image of leather, spikes, and other taboo articles of clothing were widely influential during the glam metal era of the 1980s. <i>The Guardian</i> referred to <i>British Steel</i> as the record that defines heavy metal. Despite a decline in exposure during the mid-1990s, the band has once again seen a resurgence, including worldwide tours, being inaugural inductees into the VH1 Rock Honors in 2006, receiving a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 2010, and having their songs featured in video games such as <i>Guitar Hero</i> and the <i>Rock Band</i> series.

</p>
<p><b>The Libertines</b> are an English rock band, formed in London in 1997 by frontmen Carl Barât (vocals/guitar) and Pete Doherty (vocals/guitar). The band, centred on the songwriting partnership of Barât and Doherty, has also included John Hassall (bass), and Gary Powell (drums) for most of its recording career. The band was part of the garage rock revival and spearheaded the movement in the UK.
</p><p>The band gained some notoriety in the early 2000s, due to Doherty's use of illegal drugs and conflicts between Barât and Doherty. Although their mainstream success was initially limited, their profile soon grew, culminating in a No. 2 single and No. 1 album on the UK Charts. In December 2004, their self-titled second album was voted the second best album of the year by <i>NME</i> magazine. The first two of their full-length LPs were produced by Mick Jones, of the British punk band The Clash.
</p><p>In spite of their critical and commercial success, the band's music was often eclipsed by its internal conflicts, stemming from Doherty's addictions to crack cocaine and heroin, which eventually led to the break-up of the band. Doherty has since stated that the break-up of the band was due to relationship difficulties between Barât and himself that were not related to his drug addictions. The members of the Libertines went on to form new bands with varying degrees of success.
</p><p>In August 2010, the four members of the Libertines reunited to play a series of shows, including slots at the 2010 Reading and Leeds Festivals. The reunion shows received a highly positive response from the press and fans. In April 2014 the Libertines announced they would again reform for a show at London's Hyde Park. In November 2014 the band signed a record deal with Virgin EMI Records, and released their third album, <i>Anthems for Doomed Youth</i> on 11 September 2015.</p>"

</p>
<p><b>The Animals</b> (also billed as <b>Eric Burdon and the Animals</b>) are an English rock band, formed in Newcastle upon Tyne in the early 1960s. The band moved to London upon finding fame in 1964. The Animals were known for their gritty, bluesy sound and deep-voiced frontman Eric Burdon, as exemplified by their signature song and transatlantic number-one hit single ""The House of the Rising Sun"" as well as by hits such as  ""We Gotta Get Out of This Place"", ""It's My Life"", ""Don't Bring Me Down"", ""I'm Crying"", ""See See Rider"" and ""Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood."" The band balanced tough, rock-edged pop singles against rhythm-and-blues-oriented album material and were part of the British Invasion of the US.
</p><p>The Animals underwent numerous personnel changes in the mid-1960s, and suffered from poor business management, leading the original incarnation to split up in 1966. Burdon assembled a mostly new lineup of musicians under the name Eric Burdon and the Animals; the much-changed act moved to California and achieved commercial success as a psychedelic and hard rock band with hits such as ""San Franciscan Nights"", ""When I Was Young"" and ""Sky Pilot"" before disbanding at the end of the decade. Altogether, the group had 10 top-20 hits in both the UK Singles Chart and the US <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100.
</p><p>The original lineup of Burdon, Alan Price, Chas Chandler, Hilton Valentine and John Steel reunited for a one-off benefit concert in Newcastle in 1968. They later launched brief comebacks in 1975 and 1983. Several partial regroupings of the original-era members have occurred since then under various names. The Animals were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994.

<p><b>Wilco</b> is an American alternative rock band based in Chicago, Illinois. The band was formed in 1994 by the remaining members of alternative country group Uncle Tupelo following singer Jay Farrar's departure. Wilco's lineup changed frequently during its first decade, with only singer Jeff Tweedy and bassist John Stirratt remaining from the original incarnation. Since early 2004, the lineup has been unchanged, consisting of Tweedy, Stirratt, guitarist Nels Cline, multi-instrumentalist Pat Sansone, keyboard player Mikael Jorgensen, and drummer Glenn Kotche. Wilco has released twelve studio albums, a live double album, and four collaborations: three with Billy Bragg and one with The Minus 5.
</p><p>Wilco's music has been inspired by a wide variety of artists and styles, including Bill Fay, The Beatles and Television, and has in turn influenced music by a number of modern alternative rock acts. The band continued in the alternative country style of Uncle Tupelo on its debut album <i>A.M.</i> (1995), but has since introduced more experimental aspects to their music, including elements of alternative rock and classic pop. Wilco's musical style has evolved from a 1990s country rock sound to a current ""eclectic indie rock collective that touches on many eras and genres"".</p><p>Wilco garnered media attention for their fourth album, <i>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</i> (2001), and the controversy surrounding it. After the recording sessions were complete, Reprise Records rejected the album and dismissed Wilco from the label. As part of a buy-out deal, Reprise gave Wilco the rights to the album for free. After streaming <i>Foxtrot</i> on its website, Wilco sold the album to Nonesuch Records in 2002. Both record labels are subsidiaries of Warner Music Group, leading one critic to say the album showed ""how screwed up the music business is in the early twenty-first century."" <i>Yankee Hotel Foxtrot</i> is Wilco's most successful release to date, selling over 670,000 copies. Wilco won two Grammy Awards for their fifth studio album, 2004's <i>A Ghost Is Born</i>, including Best Alternative Music Album.

Following Phillips' departure, Genesis recruited Collins and Hackett and recorded <i>Nursery Cryme</i> (1971). Their live shows began to feature Gabriel's theatrical costumes and performances. <i>Foxtrot</i> (1972) was their first hit in the UK and <i>Selling England by the Pound</i> (1973) reached number three there, featuring their first UK hit ""I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)"".

Collins left Genesis in 1996, and Banks and Rutherford replaced him with Ray Wilson, who appeared on their final album <i>Calling All Stations</i> (1997). The commercial failure of the album led to a group hiatus. Banks, Rutherford and Collins reunited for the Turn It On Again Tour in 2007, and again in 2021 for The Last Domino? Tour.

</p>
<p><b>Neutral Milk Hotel</b> was an American band formed in Ruston, Louisiana, by musician Jeff Mangum. They were active from 1989 to 1998, and then, from 2013 to 2015. The band's music featured a deliberately low-quality sound, influenced by indie rock and psychedelic folk. Mangum wrote surreal and opaque lyrics that covered a wide range of topics, including love, spirituality, nostalgia, sex, and loneliness. He and the other band members played a variety of instruments, including non-traditional rock instruments like the singing saw, uilleann pipes, and Digital Horn.
</p><p>Neutral Milk Hotel began as one of Mangum's home recording projects. In 1994, he released the song ""Everything Is"" on Cher Doll Records. The song's exposure convinced him to record more music under this name. In 1996, he worked with childhood friend Robert Schneider to record the album <i>On Avery Island</i>, which received modest reviews and sold around 5,000 copies. Mangum recruited musicians Julian Koster, Jeremy Barnes, and Scott Spillane for the band's second album, <i>In the Aeroplane Over the Sea</i>. Its 1998 release received mostly positive, but not laudatory reviews.
</p><p>While on tour, the band's popularity grew through Internet exposure. This negatively affected Mangum, whose mental health began to deteriorate; he did not want to continue touring and Neutral Milk Hotel went on hiatus shortly after. During their hiatus, Neutral Milk Hotel gained a cult following and the critical standing of <i>In the Aeroplane Over the Sea</i> rose tremendously. Several music outlets such as <i>Pitchfork</i> and <i>Blender</i> called <i>In the Aeroplane Over the Sea</i> a landmark album for indie rock and one of the greatest albums of the 1990s. Many indie rock groups such as Arcade Fire and the Decemberists were influenced by Neutral Milk Hotel's eclectic music and earnest lyrics. Neutral Milk Hotel reunited in 2013 and undertook a reunion tour before another hiatus in 2015.

</p>

<p><b>Frédéric François Chopin</b> (born <b>Fryderyk Franciszek Chopin</b>; 1 March 1810 – 17 October 1849) was a Polish composer and virtuoso pianist of the Romantic period, who wrote primarily for solo piano. He has maintained worldwide renown as a leading musician of his era, one whose ""poetic genius was based on a professional technique that was without equal in his generation"".</p><p>Chopin was born in Żelazowa Wola in the Duchy of Warsaw and grew up in Warsaw, which in 1815 became part of Congress Poland. A child prodigy, he completed his musical education and composed his earlier works in Warsaw before leaving Poland at the age of 20, less than a month before the outbreak of the November 1830 Uprising. At 21, he settled in Paris. Thereafter – in the last 18 years of his life – he gave only 30 public performances, preferring the more intimate atmosphere of the salon. He supported himself by selling his compositions and by giving piano lessons, for which he was in high demand. Chopin formed a friendship with Franz Liszt and was admired by many of his other musical contemporaries, including Robert Schumann.
</p><p>After a failed engagement to Maria Wodzińska from 1836 to 1837, he maintained an often troubled relationship with the French writer Aurore Dupin (known by her pen name George Sand). A brief and unhappy visit to Mallorca with Sand in 1838–39 would prove one of his most productive periods of composition. In his final years, he was supported financially by his admirer Jane Stirling, who also arranged for him to visit Scotland in 1848. For most of his life, Chopin was in poor health. He died in Paris in 1849 at the age of 39, probably of pericarditis aggravated by tuberculosis.
</p><p>All of Chopin's compositions include the piano. They are mostly for solo piano, though he also wrote two piano concertos, some chamber music, and 19 songs set to Polish lyrics. His piano pieces are technically demanding and expanded the limits of the instrument; his own performances were noted for their nuance and sensitivity. Chopin's major piano works include mazurkas, waltzes, nocturnes, polonaises, the instrumental <i>ballade</i> (which Chopin created as an instrumental genre), études, impromptus, scherzi, preludes, and sonatas, some published only posthumously. Among the influences on his style of composition were Polish folk music, the classical tradition of J. S. Bach, Mozart, and Schubert, and the atmosphere of the Paris salons, of which he was a frequent guest. His innovations in style, harmony, and musical form, and his association of music with nationalism, were influential throughout and after the late Romantic period.
</p><p>Chopin's music, his status as one of music's earliest celebrities, his indirect association with political insurrection, his high-profile love life, and his early death have made him a leading symbol of the Romantic era. His works remain popular, and he has been the subject of numerous films and biographies of varying historical fidelity. Among his many memorials is the Fryderyk Chopin Institute, which was created by the Parliament of Poland to research and promote his life and works. It hosts the International Chopin Piano Competition, a prestigious competition devoted entirely to his works.

With their ""girl power"" mantra, they redefined the girl-group concept by targeting a young female fanbase. They led the teen pop resurgence of the 1990s, were a major part of the Cool Britannia era, and became pop culture icons of the decade.</p><p>The Spice Girls formed through auditions held with the intent to create a girl group to compete with the British boy bands popular at the time. They quickly left the managers and took creative control over their sound and image. The Spice Girls signed to Virgin Records and released their debut single ""Wannabe"" in 1996, which reached number one on the charts of 37 countries. Their debut album, <i>Spice</i> (1996), sold more than 23 million copies worldwide, becoming the best-selling album by a female group in history. It produced three more number-one singles: ""Say You'll Be There"", ""2 Become 1"" and ""Who Do You Think You Are""/""Mama"". Their second album <i>Spiceworld</i> (1997) was another global success, selling more than 14 million copies worldwide. They achieved three number-one singles from the album with: ""Spice Up Your Life"", ""Too Much"" and ""Viva Forever"". Both albums encapsulated the group's dance-pop style and message of female empowerment, with vocal and songwriting contributions shared equally by the members. 
</p><p>In 1997 the Spice Girls made their live debut concert tour and starred in their own film based on themselves called <i>Spice World</i>, both to commercial success. In early 1998 the group embarked on their Spiceworld Tour, which was attended by an estimated 2.1 million people worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing concert tour by a female group, grossing an estimated $220–250 million in ticket sales. Halliwell left the Spice Girls mid-tour in May 1998. Following a number-one single with ""Goodbye"" (1998) and a successful 1999 concert tour, the Spice Girls released their R&amp;B-influenced third album <i>Forever</i> (2000). It featured their ninth number one single with ""Holler""/""Let Love Lead the Way"", setting a record for most UK number ones by a girl group of all time.

Since then, they reunited for two concert tours; the Return of the Spice Girls (2007–2008) as a five-piece and Spice World – 2019 tour without Beckham, both of which won the <i>Billboard</i> Live Music Award for highest-grossing engagements, making the Spice Girls the top touring all-female group from 1998 to 2020. They also reunited briefly in 2012 for a critically acclaimed live performance at the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony.</p><p>The Spice Girls have sold 100 million records worldwide, making them the best-selling girl group of all time, one of the bestselling artists, and the most successful British pop act since the Beatles. They received five Brit Awards, three American Music Awards, four <i>Billboard</i> Music Awards, three MTV Europe Music Awards and one MTV Video Music Award. In 2000, they became the youngest recipients of the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. According to <i>Rolling Stone</i> journalist and biographer David Sinclair, they were the most widely recognised group since the Beatles. Other measures of the Spice Girls' success include iconic symbolism such as Halliwell's Union Jack dress, and their nicknames, which were given to them by the British press. Under the guidance of their mentor and manager Simon Fuller, their endorsement deals and merchandise made them one of most successful marketing engines ever, with a global gross income estimated at $500–800 million by May 1998.

</p>
<p><b>Explosions in the Sky</b> is an American post-rock band from Texas. The quartet originally played under the name Breaker Morant, then changed to the current name in 1999. The band has garnered popularity beyond the post-rock scene for their elaborately developed guitar work, narratively styled instrumentals—what they refer to as ""cathartic mini-symphonies""—and their enthusiastic and emotional live shows. They primarily play with three electric guitars and a drum kit, although band member Michael James will at times exchange his electric guitar for a bass guitar. The band has later added a fifth member to their live performances. The band's music is almost purely instrumental.

<p><b>In Flames</b> is a Swedish heavy metal band, formed by guitarist Jesper Strömblad in Gothenburg in 1990. Alongside At the Gates and Dark Tranquillity, In Flames pioneered the genres known as Swedish death metal and melodic death metal.
</p><p>During the band's early years, In Flames had a varying group of musicians recording with them, including many session musicians. By the release of <i>Colony</i> (1999), the group had established a stable lineup. Their sixth studio album <i>Reroute to Remain</i> (2002) showed the band moving toward a newer style of music that moved further away from melodic death metal and closer to alternative metal. This decision was criticized by fans of the group's heavier metal sound; however, it increased the band's mainstream audience and bolstered their album sales. As of 2008, In Flames has sold over two million records worldwide.</p><p>Since the band's inception, In Flames have released fourteen studio albums, three EPs, and two live DVDs, their latest release being their fourteenth studio album <i>Foregone</i> in 2023. In Flames has been nominated for three Grammis Awards. They won two of these nominations; one for <i>Soundtrack to Your Escape</i> (2004) in the ""Hard Rock/Metal of the Year"" category, and one nomination for their following album <i>Come Clarity</i> (2006) in the same category.
