</p>
<p><b>Coldplay</b> are a British rock band formed in London in 1997. They consist of vocalist and pianist Chris Martin, guitarist Jonny Buckland, bassist Guy Berryman, drummer Will Champion and creative director Phil Harvey. They met at University College London and began playing music together from 1996 to 1998, initially calling themselves Starfish.
</p><p>After independently releasing an extended play, <i>Safety</i> (1998), Coldplay signed with Parlophone in 1999. The band's debut album, <i>Parachutes</i> (2000), included their breakthrough single ""Yellow"" and received a Brit Award for British Album of the Year, a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album and a Mercury Prize nomination. Their second album, <i>A Rush of Blood to the Head</i> (2002), won the same accolades and included the single ""Clocks"", which won a Grammy Award for Record of the Year. The band's third album, <i>X&amp;Y</i> (2005), which completed what the band considered to be a trilogy, and their fourth album, <i>Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends</i> (2008), were both nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Album, with the latter winning; both albums were the best-selling of their respective years, topping the charts in over 30 countries. <i>Viva la Vida</i> was also nominated for Album of the Year, while its title track became the first single by a British group to simultaneously reach number one in the United Kingdom and United States in the 21st century.
</p><p>Coldplay further diversified their sound over their next five studio albums, the most recent being <i>Music of the Spheres</i> (2021). Each album presented a unique theme and added new musical styles to the band's original repertoire, including electronica, ambient, pop, R&amp;B, classical and progressive rock. They are also known for ""euphoric"", and ""immersive"" live performances, which <i>NME</i> said are when the band ""come alive and make the most sense"". In 2018, a career-spanning documentary directed by Mat Whitecross was released in select cinemas to mark the band's 20th anniversary.
</p><p>With 100 million albums sold worldwide, Coldplay are one of the best-selling music acts of all time. According to Fuse, they are the sixth-most awarded group in history, which includes the most Brit Award nominations and wins for a band. Other notable achievements include the seventh-highest-grossing tour of all time, three of the 50 highest-selling albums in the United Kingdom, the most number-one albums in the country without ever missing the top, and becoming the first British group to debut at number one on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. Coldplay are considered one of the most influential bands of the 21st century, with <i>Forbes</i> describing them as the standard for the current alternative music scene. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame included <i>A Rush of Blood to the Head</i> on their ""200 Definitive Albums"" list and the single ""Yellow"" is part of their ""Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll"" exhibition for being one of the most successful and important recordings in the music industry. Despite their popularity and impact, Coldplay have earned a reputation as polarizing music icons.

</p>
<p><b>Radiohead</b> are an English rock band formed in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, in 1985. The band consists of Thom Yorke (vocals, guitar, piano, keyboards); brothers Jonny Greenwood (lead guitar, keyboards, other instruments) and Colin Greenwood (bass); Ed O'Brien (guitar, backing vocals); and Philip Selway (drums, percussion). They have worked with the producer Nigel Godrich and the cover artist Stanley Donwood since 1994. Radiohead's experimental approach is credited with advancing the sound of alternative rock.
</p><p>Radiohead signed to EMI in 1991 and released their debut album, <i>Pablo Honey,</i> in 1993; their debut single, ""Creep"", became a worldwide hit. Radiohead's popularity and critical standing rose with the release of <i>The Bends</i> in 1995. Radiohead's third album, <i>OK Computer</i> (1997), brought them international fame; noted for its complex production and themes of modern alienation, it is acclaimed as a landmark record and one of the best albums in popular music.
</p><p>Radiohead's fourth album, <i>Kid A</i> (2000), marked a dramatic change in style, incorporating influences from electronic music, jazz, classical music and krautrock. Though <i>Kid A</i> divided listeners, it later attracted wide acclaim. It was followed by <i>Amnesiac</i> (2001), recorded in the same sessions. <i>Hail to the Thief</i> (2003), with lyrics addressing the War on Terror, blended the band's rock and electronic sides, and was Radiohead's final album for EMI.
</p><p>Radiohead self-released their seventh album, <i>In Rainbows</i> (2007), as a download for which customers could set their own price, to critical and chart success. Their eighth album, <i>The King of Limbs</i> (2011), an exploration of rhythm, was developed using extensive looping and sampling. <i>A Moon Shaped Pool</i> (2016) prominently featured Jonny Greenwood's orchestral arrangements. Yorke, Jonny Greenwood, Selway, and O'Brien have released solo albums; in 2021, Yorke and Jonny Greenwood debuted a new band, the Smile.
</p><p>By 2011, Radiohead had sold more than 30 million albums worldwide. Their awards include six Grammy Awards and four Ivor Novello Awards, and they hold five Mercury Prize nominations, the most of any act. Seven Radiohead singles have reached the top 10 on the UK Singles Chart: ""Creep"" (1992), ""Street Spirit (Fade Out)"" (1996), ""Paranoid Android"" (1997), ""Karma Police"" (1997), ""No Surprises"" (1998), ""Pyramid Song"" (2001), and ""There There"" (2003). ""Creep"" and ""Nude"" (2008) reached the top 40 on the US <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. <i>Rolling Stone</i> named Radiohead one of the 100 greatest artists of all time, and <i>Rolling Stone</i> readers voted them the second-best artist of the 2000s. Five Radiohead albums have been included in <i>Rolling Stone</i><span>'</span>s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time lists. Radiohead were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2019.

Red Hot Chili Peppers,Los Angeles,1982–present,Red Hot Chili Peppers,"<p class=""mw-empty-elt"">


</p>
<p><b>Red Hot Chili Peppers</b> are an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1982, comprising vocalist Anthony Kiedis, bassist Flea, drummer Chad Smith, and guitarist John Frusciante. Their music incorporates elements of alternative rock, funk, punk rock, hard rock, hip hop, and psychedelic rock. Their eclectic range has influenced genres such as funk metal, rap metal, rap rock, and nu metal. With over 120 million records sold worldwide, Red Hot Chili Peppers are one of the best-selling bands of all time. They hold the records for most number-one singles (14), most cumulative weeks at number one (85) and most top-ten songs (25) on the <i>Billboard</i> Alternative Songs chart. They have won six Grammy Awards, were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012, and in 2022 received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
</p><p>Red Hot Chili Peppers were formed in Los Angeles by Kiedis, Flea, guitarist Hillel Slovak and drummer Jack Irons. Due to commitments to other bands, Slovak and Irons did not play on the band's 1984 self-titled debut album, which instead featured guitarist Jack Sherman and drummer Cliff Martinez. Slovak rejoined for their second album, <i>Freaky Styley</i> (1985), and Irons for their third, <i>The Uplift Mofo Party Plan</i> (1987). Irons left after Slovak died of a drug overdose in June 1988.
</p><p>With new recruits Frusciante and Smith, Red Hot Chili Peppers recorded <i>Mother's Milk</i> (1989) and their first major commercial success, <i>Blood Sugar Sex Magik</i> (1991). Frusciante was uncomfortable with their newfound popularity and left abruptly on tour in 1992. After a series of temporary guitarists, he was replaced by Dave Navarro, who appeared on the group's sixth album, <i>One Hot Minute</i> (1995). Although successful, the album failed to match the critical or popular acclaim of <i>Blood Sugar Sex Magik</i>. Frusciante and Kiedis struggled with drug addiction throughout the 1990s.
</p><p>In 1998, following Navarro's departure, Frusciante rejoined the band. Their seventh album, <i>Californication</i> (1999), became their biggest commercial success, with 16 million copies sold worldwide. <i>By the Way</i> (2002) and <i>Stadium Arcadium</i> (2006) were also successful; <i>Stadium Arcadium</i> was their first album to reach number one on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 chart. Frusciante left again in 2009 to focus on his solo career; he was replaced by Josh Klinghoffer, who appeared on <i>I'm with You</i> (2011) and <i>The Getaway</i> (2016), before Frusciante rejoined in 2019. They released their 12th and 13th albums, <i>Unlimited Love</i> and <i>Return of the Dream Canteen</i>, in 2022.</p>"

<p><b>The Killers</b> are an American rock band formed in Las Vegas in 2001 by Brandon Flowers (lead vocals, keyboards, bass) and Dave Keuning (lead guitar, backing vocals). After going through a number of short-term bass players and drummers in their early days, both Mark Stoermer (bass, rhythm guitar, backing vocals) and Ronnie Vannucci Jr. (drums, percussion) joined the band in 2002. The band's name is derived from a logo on the bass drum of a fictitious band portrayed in the music video for the New Order song ""Crystal"".</p><p>The Killers have released seven studio albums, each of which reached the top spot on the UK Albums Chart: <i>Hot Fuss</i> (2004), <i>Sam's Town</i> (2006), <i>Day &amp; Age</i> (2008), <i>Battle Born</i> (2012), <i>Wonderful Wonderful</i> (2017), <i>Imploding the Mirage</i> (2020), and <i>Pressure Machine</i> (2021). They have also released a B-sides and rarities compilation, <i>Sawdust</i> (2007); a live album, <i>Live from the Royal Albert Hall</i> (2009); a greatest-hits album, <i>Direct Hits</i> (2013); and a Christmas compilation, <i>Don't Waste Your Wishes</i> (2016).
</p><p>Since 2016 and 2017 respectively, both Stoermer and Keuning have had extended periods of hiatus from the band, though both remain official members. Stoermer mostly retired from touring, citing both exhaustion from the road and lingering effects from a pyrotechnics accident, while Keuning has released a solo album. Despite his hiatus from touring, Stoermer has participated in recording sessions for <i>Wonderful Wonderful</i> and <i>Imploding the Mirage</i>, and it was announced that Keuning was participating in recording <i>Pressure Machine</i>, which was released on August 13, 2021. Ted Sablay, who had served as a touring keyboardist and rhythm guitarist for the band since 2006, assumed lead guitar duties for live shows in Keuning's absence, while touring rhythm guitarist and keyboardist Jake Blanton took up the job of bassist and has taken Stoermer's place in live shows. With Sablay moving to lead guitar, the band hired Taylor Milne and Robbie Connolly to play rhythm guitar and keyboards live.
</p><p>The Killers are considered one of the biggest rock bands of the 21st century, selling more than 28 million records worldwide, including 10.8 million in the US alone. They have performed in over 50 countries and on six continents, headlining venues such as Madison Square Garden, Wembley Stadium and Glastonbury Festival (2007 and 2019).

</p>
<p><b>Foo Fighters</b> are an American rock band formed in Seattle in 1994. Foo Fighters was initially formed as a one-man project by former Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl. Following the success of the 1995 eponymous debut album, Grohl (lead vocals, guitar) recruited a band consisting of Nate Mendel (bass guitar), William Goldsmith (drums), and Pat Smear (guitar). After a succession of lineup changes, including the departures of Goldsmith and Smear, the band formed its core lineup in 1999, consisting of Grohl, Mendel, Chris Shiflett (guitar), and Taylor Hawkins (drums). Smear rejoined in 2005, and Rami Jaffee (keys) joined in 2017.
</p><p>Prior to the release of the debut Foo Fighters album, Grohl recruited Mendel and Goldsmith, both formerly of Sunny Day Real Estate, and Smear, who had played with Nirvana on tour. The band began with performances in Portland, Oregon. Goldsmith quit during the recording of their second album, <i>The Colour and the Shape</i> (1997); most of the drum parts were re-recorded by Grohl. Smear departed soon afterward but appeared as a guest with the band frequently from 2005; he rejoined in 2010.
</p><p>Smear and Goldsmith were replaced by Franz Stahl and Taylor Hawkins; Stahl was fired before the recording of the group's third album, <i>There Is Nothing Left to Lose</i> (1999). The band briefly continued as a trio until Chris Shiflett joined on guitar after the completion of <i>There Is Nothing Left to Lose</i>. Foo Fighters released their fourth album, <i>One by One</i>, in 2002. It was followed with the two-disc <i>In Your Honor</i> (2005), which was split between acoustic songs and heavier material. Foo Fighters released their sixth album, <i>Echoes, Silence, Patience &amp; Grace</i>, in 2007.
</p><p>For Foo Fighters' seventh studio album, <i>Wasting Light</i> (2011), produced by Butch Vig, Smear returned as a full member. <i>Sonic Highways</i> (2014) was released as the soundtrack to the television miniseries directed by Grohl. <i>Concrete and Gold</i> (2017) was the second Foo Fighters album to reach number one in the United States and their first studio album to feature longtime session and touring keyboardist Rami Jaffee as a full member. The band's tenth album, <i>Medicine at Midnight</i> (2021), was the last to feature Hawkins, who died in March 2022.
</p><p>Over the course of their career, Foo Fighters have won 15 Grammy Awards, including Best Rock Album five times, making them among the most successful rock acts in Grammy history. In 2021, the band was announced as recipients of the first-ever ""Global Icon"" award at the 2021 MTV Video Music Awards. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2021, their first year of eligibility.

<p><b>Linkin Park</b> is an American rock band from Agoura Hills, California. The band's current lineup comprises vocalist/rhythm guitarist/keyboardist Mike Shinoda, lead guitarist Brad Delson, bassist Dave Farrell, DJ/turntablist Joe Hahn and drummer Rob Bourdon, all of whom are founding members. Vocalists Mark Wakefield and Chester Bennington are former members of the band. Categorized as alternative rock, Linkin Park's earlier music spanned a fusion of heavy metal and hip hop, while their later music features more electronica and pop elements.
</p><p>Formed in 1996, Linkin Park rose to international fame with their debut studio album, <i>Hybrid Theory</i> (2000), which became certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Released during the peak of the nu metal scene, the album's singles' heavy airplay on MTV led the singles ""One Step Closer"", ""Crawling"" and ""In the End"" all to chart highly on the US Mainstream Rock chart. The lattermost also crossed over to the nation's <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. Their second album, <i>Meteora</i> (2003), continued the band's success. The band explored experimental sounds on their third album, <i>Minutes to Midnight</i> (2007). By the end of the decade, Linkin Park was among the most successful and popular rock acts.</p><p>The band continued to explore a wider variation of musical types on their fourth album, <i>A Thousand Suns</i> (2010), layering their music with more electronic sounds. The band's fifth album, <i>Living Things</i> (2012), combined musical elements from all of their previous records. Their sixth album, <i>The Hunting Party</i> (2014), returned to a heavier rock sound, and their seventh album, <i>One More Light</i> (2017), was a substantially more pop-oriented record. Linkin Park went on a hiatus when longtime lead vocalist Bennington died in July 2017. In April 2022, Shinoda revealed the band was neither working on new music nor planning on touring for the foreseeable future.
</p><p>Linkin Park is among the best-selling bands of the 21st century and the world's best-selling music artists, having sold over 100 million records worldwide.

The Rolling Stones,London,1962–present,The Rolling Stones,"<p class=""mw-empty-elt"">



</p>
<p><b>The Rolling Stones</b> are an English rock band formed in London in 1962. Active for six decades, they are one of the most popular and enduring bands of the rock era. In the early 1960s, the Rolling Stones pioneered the gritty, rhythmically driven sound that came to define hard rock. Their first stable line-up consisted of vocalist Mick Jagger, multi-instrumentalist Brian Jones, guitarist Keith Richards, bassist Bill Wyman, and drummer Charlie Watts. During their formative years, Jones was the primary leader: he assembled the band, named it, and drove their sound and image. After Andrew Loog Oldham became the group's manager in 1963, he encouraged them to write their own songs. Jagger and Richards became the primary creative force behind the band, alienating Jones, who had developed a drug addiction that interfered with his ability to contribute meaningfully.
</p><p>Rooted in blues and early rock and roll, the Rolling Stones started out playing covers and were at the forefront of the British Invasion in 1964, becoming identified with the youthful and rebellious counterculture of the 1960s. They then found greater success with their own material, as ""(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction"" (1965), ""Get Off of My Cloud"" (1965), and ""Paint It Black"" (1966) became international number-one hits. <i>Aftermath</i> (1966) – their first entirely original album – is considered by <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> to be the most important of their formative records. In 1967, they had the double-sided hit ""Ruby Tuesday""/""Let's Spend the Night Together"" and experimented with psychedelic rock on <i>Their Satanic Majesties Request</i>. They returned to their rhythm and blues roots with hit songs such as ""Jumpin' Jack Flash"" (1968) and ""Honky Tonk Women"" (1969), and albums such as <i>Beggars Banquet</i> (1968), featuring ""Sympathy for the Devil"", and <i>Let It Bleed</i> (1969), featuring ""You Can't Always Get What You Want"" and ""Gimme Shelter"". <i>Let It Bleed</i> was the first of five consecutive number-one albums in the UK.
</p><p>Jones left the band shortly before his death in 1969, having been replaced by guitarist Mick Taylor. That year they were first introduced on stage as ""The Greatest Rock and Roll Band in the World"". <i>Sticky Fingers</i> (1971), which yielded ""Brown Sugar"" and included the first usage of their tongue and lips logo, was their first of eight consecutive number-one studio albums in the US. <i>Exile on Main St.</i> (1972), featuring ""Tumbling Dice"", and <i>Goats Head Soup</i> (1973), yielding the hit ballad ""Angie"", were also best sellers. Taylor was replaced by Ronnie Wood in 1974. The band continued to release successful albums, including their two largest sellers: <i>Some Girls</i> (1978), featuring ""Miss You"", and <i>Tattoo You</i> (1981), featuring ""Start Me Up"". <i>Steel Wheels</i> (1989) was widely considered a comeback album and was followed by <i>Voodoo Lounge</i> (1994), a worldwide number-one album. Both releases were promoted by large stadium and arena tours, as the Stones continued to be a huge concert attraction; by 2007 they had recorded the all-time highest-grossing concert tour three times, and as recently as 2021 they were the highest-earning live act of the year. From Wyman's departure in 1993 to Watts' death in 2021, the band continued as a four-piece core, with Darryl Jones playing bass on tour and on most studio recordings, while Steve Jordan became their touring drummer following Watts' death. Their 2016 album, <i>Blue &amp; Lonesome</i>, became their twelfth UK number-one album.
</p><p>The Rolling Stones' estimated record sales of 200 million make them one of the best-selling music artists of all time. The band has won three Grammy Awards and a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2004. <i>Billboard</i> magazine and <i>Rolling Stone</i> have ranked the band as one of the greatest of all time.

Daft Punk,Paris,1993–2021,Daft Punk,"<p class=""mw-empty-elt"">

</p>
<p><b>Daft Punk</b> were a French electronic music duo formed in 1993 in Paris by Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo. They achieved popularity in the late 1990s as part of the French house movement, combining elements of house music with funk, disco, rock and pop. They garnered acclaim and commercial success and are regarded as one of the most influential acts in dance music.
</p><p>Bangalter and Homem-Christo formed Daft Punk after their indie rock band Darlin' disbanded and began experimenting with drum machines and synthesisers. Their debut studio album, <i>Homework</i>, was released by Virgin Records in 1997 to positive reviews, backed by the singles ""Around the World"" and ""Da Funk"". From 1999, Daft Punk assumed robot personas for public appearances, with helmets, outfits and gloves to disguise their identities; they made few media appearances. They were managed from 1996 to 2008 by Pedro Winter, the head of Ed Banger Records.
</p><p>Daft Punk's second album, <i>Discovery</i> (2001), had further success, with the hit singles ""One More Time"", ""Digital Love"" and ""Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger"". It became the basis for an animated film, <i>Interstella 5555,</i> supervised by the Japanese artist Leiji Matsumoto. Daft Punk's third album, <i>Human After All</i> (2005), received mixed reviews, though the singles ""Robot Rock"" and ""Technologic"" achieved success in the United Kingdom. Daft Punk directed an avant-garde science-fiction film, <i>Electroma</i>, released in 2006. They toured throughout 2006 and 2007 and released the live album <i>Alive 2007</i>, which won a Grammy Award for Best Electronic/Dance Album; the tour is credited for popularising dance music in North America. Daft Punk composed the score for the 2010 film <i>Tron: Legacy</i>.
</p><p>In 2013, Daft Punk left Virgin for Columbia Records and released their fourth and final album, <i>Random Access Memories</i>, to acclaim; the lead single, ""Get Lucky"", reached the top 10 in the charts of 27 countries. <i>Random Access Memories</i> won five Grammy Awards in 2014, including Album of the Year and Record of the Year for ""Get Lucky"". In 2016, Daft Punk gained their only number one on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 with ""Starboy"", a collaboration with the Weeknd. In 2015, <i>Rolling Stone</i> ranked them the 12th greatest musical duo of all time. They announced their split in 2021.

</p>
<p><b>Green Day</b> is an American rock band formed in the East Bay of California in 1987 by lead vocalist and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong, together with bassist and backing vocalist Mike Dirnt. For most of the band's career, they have been a power trio with drummer Tré Cool, who replaced John Kiffmeyer in 1990 before the recording of the band's second studio album, <i>Kerplunk</i> (1991). Touring guitarist Jason White became a full-time member in 2012, but returned to his touring role in 2016. Before taking its current name in 1989, Green Day was called <b>Sweet Children</b>, and they were part of the late 1980s/early 1990s Bay Area punk scene that emerged from the 924 Gilman Street club in Berkeley, California. The band's early releases were with the independent record label Lookout! Records. In 1994, their major-label debut <i>Dookie</i>, released through Reprise Records, became a breakout success and eventually shipped over 10 million copies in the U.S. Alongside fellow California punk bands Bad Religion, the Offspring, Rancid, NOFX, Pennywise and Social Distortion, Green Day is credited with popularizing mainstream interest in punk rock in the U.S.
</p><p>Though the albums <i>Insomniac</i> (1995), <i>Nimrod</i> (1997), and <i>Warning</i> (2000) did not match the success of <i>Dookie</i>, they were still successful, with the former two reaching double platinum status, while the latter achieved gold. Green Day's seventh album, a rock opera called <i>American Idiot</i> (2004), found popularity with a younger generation, selling six million copies in the U.S. Their next album, <i>21st Century Breakdown</i>, was released in 2009 and achieved the band's best chart performance. It was followed by a trilogy of albums, <i>¡Uno!</i>, <i>¡Dos!</i>, and <i>¡Tré!</i>, released in September, November, and December 2012, respectively. The trilogy did not perform as well as expected commercially, in comparison to their previous albums, largely due to lack of promotion and Armstrong entering rehab. Their twelfth studio album, <i>Revolution Radio</i>, was released in October 2016 and became their third to debut at No. 1 on the <i> Billboard</i> 200. The band's thirteenth studio album, <i>Father of All Motherfuckers</i>, was released on February 7, 2020.
</p><p>In 2010, a stage adaptation of <i>American Idiot</i> debuted on Broadway. The musical was nominated for three Tony Awards: Best Musical, Best Scenic Design, and Best Lighting Design, winning the latter two. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2015, their first year of eligibility. Members of the band have collaborated on the side projects Pinhead Gunpowder, the Network, Foxboro Hot Tubs, the Longshot, and the Coverups. They have also worked on solo careers.
</p><p>Green Day has sold more than 75 million records worldwide, making them one of the world's best-selling artists. The group has been nominated for 20 Grammy awards and has won five of them with Best Alternative Album for <i>Dookie</i>, Best Rock Album for <i>American Idiot</i> and <i>21st Century Breakdown</i>, Record of the Year for ""Boulevard of Broken Dreams"", and Best Musical Show Album for <i>American Idiot: The Original Broadway Cast Recording</i>.

</p>
<p><b>The Beatles</b> were an English rock band, formed in Liverpool in 1960, that comprised John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr. They are regarded as the most influential band of all time and were integral to the development of 1960s counterculture and popular music's recognition as an art form. Rooted in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock 'n' roll, their sound incorporated elements of classical music and traditional pop in innovative ways; the band also explored music styles ranging from folk and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock. As pioneers in recording, songwriting and artistic presentation, the Beatles revolutionised many aspects of the music industry and were often publicised as leaders of the era's youth and sociocultural movements.</p><p>Led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, the Beatles evolved from Lennon's previous group, the Quarrymen, and built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over three years from 1960, initially with Stuart Sutcliffe playing bass. The core trio of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, together since 1958, went through a succession of drummers, including Pete Best, before asking Starr to join them in 1962. Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act, and producer George Martin guided and developed their recordings, greatly expanding their domestic success after signing to EMI Records and achieving their first hit, ""Love Me Do"", in late 1962. As their popularity grew into the intense fan frenzy dubbed ""Beatlemania"", the band acquired the nickname ""the Fab Four"", with Epstein, Martin or another member of the band's entourage sometimes informally referred to as a ""fifth Beatle"".
</p><p>By early 1964, the Beatles were international stars and had achieved unprecedented levels of critical and commercial success. They became a leading force in Britain's cultural resurgence, ushering in the British Invasion of the United States pop market, and soon made their film debut with <i>A Hard Day's Night</i> (1964). A growing desire to refine their studio efforts, coupled with the untenable nature of their concert tours, led to the band's retirement from live performances in 1966. At this time, they produced records of greater sophistication, including the albums <i>Rubber Soul</i> (1965), <i>Revolver</i> (1966) and <i>Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</i> (1967), and enjoyed further commercial success with <i>The Beatles</i> (also known as ""the White Album"", 1968) and <i>Abbey Road</i> (1969). The success of these records heralded the album era, as albums became the dominant form of record consumption over singles; they also increased public interest in psychedelic drugs and Eastern spirituality, and furthered advancements in electronic music, album art and music videos. In 1968, they founded Apple Corps, a multi-armed multimedia corporation that continues to oversee projects related to the band's legacy. After the group's break-up in 1970, all principal former members enjoyed success as solo artists and some partial reunions have occurred. Lennon was murdered in 1980 and Harrison died of lung cancer in 2001. McCartney and Starr remain musically active.
</p><p>The Beatles are the best-selling music act of all time, with estimated sales of 600 million units worldwide. They hold the record for most number-one albums on the UK Albums Chart (15), most number-one hits on the US <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 chart (20), and most singles sold in the UK (21.9 million). The band received many accolades, including seven Grammy Awards, four Brit Awards, an Academy Award (for Best Original Song Score for the 1970 documentary film <i>Let It Be</i>) and fifteen Ivor Novello Awards. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988, and each principal member was inducted individually between 1994 and 2015. In 2004 and 2011, the group topped <i>Rolling Stone</i><span>'</span>s lists of the greatest artists in history. <i>Time</i> magazine named them among the 20th century's 100 most important people.

</p><p>With Gorillaz, Albarn departed from the distinct Britpop of his band Blur, exploring a variety of musical styles including hip hop, electronic music and world music through an ""eccentrically postmodern"" approach. The band's 2001 debut album <i>Gorillaz</i>, which featured dub, Latin and punk influences, went triple platinum in the UK and double platinum in Europe, with sales driven by the success of the album's lead single ""Clint Eastwood"". Their second studio album, <i>Demon Days</i> (2005), went six times platinum in the UK and double platinum in the US and spawned the successful lead single ""Feel Good Inc.""</p><p>The band's third album, <i>Plastic Beach</i> (2010), featured environmentalist themes, a synth-pop approach and an expanded roster of featured artists.

During 2015, Remi Kabaka Jr. became a music producer for the band after more than 10 years providing the voice of Russel and was credited as such alongside Albarn and Hewlett in the official 2019 documentary <i>Gorillaz: Reject False Icons</i>. The band's fifth album, <i>Humanz</i>, was released after a seven-year hiatus on 28 April 2017. Their sixth album, <i>The Now Now</i> (2018), featured stripped-down production and a greater musical focus on Albarn.

In 2023, the band will release its eighth studio album, <i>Cracker Island</i>.
</p><p>Gorillaz has presented itself live in a variety of different ways throughout the band's history, such as hiding the touring band from the audience's view in the early years of the project, projecting animated band members on stage via computer graphics and traditional live touring featuring a fully visible live band. The band have sold over 27 million records worldwide and are cited by <i>Guinness World Records</i> as the world's ""Most Successful Virtual Band"". They have won a Grammy Award, two MTV Video Music Awards, an NME Award and four MTV Europe Music Awards.

</p><p>After self-releasing their independent album <i>We Like Digging?</i>, the band signed to Reprise Records and released the album <i>The Fourth World</i> in 1997. The album garnered a tepid response, after which the record label dropped the band and the members focused on college. In 2001, the band re-emerged as Maroon 5, pursuing a different direction and adding guitarist Valentine. The band signed with Octone Records, an independent record label with a separate joint venture relationship with J Records and released their debut album <i>Songs About Jane</i> in June 2002. Aided by the hit singles ""Harder to Breathe"", ""This Love"" and ""She Will Be Loved"", the album peaked at number six on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 chart and went quadruple platinum in 2005. In the same year, the band won the Grammy Award for Best New Artist. In 2006, Dusick left the band after suffering from serious wrist and shoulder injuries and was replaced by Matt Flynn.
</p><p>The band's second album <i>It Won't Be Soon Before Long</i> was released in May 2007.

</p><p>In 2014, Carmichael rejoined the band alongside Morton to record the fifth album <i>V</i> (roman numeral pronounced ""five""), with the band signed to Interscope Records and Levine's own label 222 Records. Following the release of <i>V</i>, it reached number one on the <i>Billboard</i> 200. In 2016, Maroon 5 recruited their long-time collaborator Sam Farrar, as the band continued for the sixth studio album <i>Red Pill Blues</i>, which was released in November 2017.

Former band member Andy Nicholson (bass guitar, backing vocals) left the band in 2006 shortly after their debut album was released.
</p><p>Arctic Monkeys were heralded as one of the first bands to come to public attention via the Internet, with commentators suggesting they represented the possibility of a change in the way in which new bands are promoted and marketed. Their debut album, <i>Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not</i> (2006), became the fastest-selling debut album in UK chart history, and has been hailed as one of the greatest debut albums. It won Best British Album at the 2007 Brit Awards. The band's second album, <i>Favourite Worst Nightmare</i> (2007), was also acclaimed by critics and won Best British Album at the 2008 BRIT Awards. They went on to release <i>Humbug</i> (2009) and <i>Suck It and See</i> (2011).
</p><p>The band's wider international fame came with the success of their critically acclaimed fifth album <i>AM</i> (2013), which was supported by the global hit ""Do I Wanna Know?"". It topped four <i>Billboard</i> charts and was certified platinum in the US. At the 2014 BRIT Awards, the album became their third to win British Album of the Year. Their sixth album, <i>Tranquility Base Hotel &amp; Casino</i> (2018), was a major departure from the band's previous guitar-heavy work, instead being piano-oriented. It received a Best Alternative Music Album nomination at the 2019 Grammy Awards, their second to do so after <i>Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not</i>.
</p><p>In the United Kingdom, the band became the first independent-label band to debut at number one in the UK with their first five albums.

U2,Dublin,1976–present,U2,"<p class=""mw-empty-elt"">

</p>
<p><b>U2</b> are an Irish rock band from Dublin, formed in 1976. The group consists of Bono (lead vocals and rhythm guitar), the Edge (lead guitar, keyboards, and backing vocals), Adam Clayton (bass guitar), and Larry Mullen Jr. (drums and percussion). Initially rooted in post-punk, U2's musical style has evolved throughout their career, yet has maintained an anthemic quality built on Bono's expressive vocals and the Edge's chiming, effects-based guitar sounds. Bono's lyrics, often embellished with spiritual imagery, focus on personal and sociopolitical themes. Popular for their live performances, the group have staged several ambitious and elaborate tours over their career.
</p><p>The band was formed when the members were teenaged pupils of Mount Temple Comprehensive School and had limited musical proficiency. Within four years, they signed with Island Records and released their debut album, <i>Boy</i> (1980). Works such as their first UK number-one album, <i>War</i> (1983), and the singles ""Sunday Bloody Sunday"" and ""Pride (In the Name of Love)"" helped establish U2's reputation as a politically and socially conscious group. By the mid-1980s, they had become renowned globally for their live act, highlighted by their performance at Live Aid in 1985. U2's fifth album, <i>The Joshua Tree</i> (1987), made them international stars and was their greatest critical and commercial success. Topping music charts around the world, it produced their only number-one singles in the US to date: ""With or Without You"" and ""I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For"".
</p><p>Facing creative stagnation and a backlash to their documentary/double album, <i>Rattle and Hum</i> (1988), U2 reinvented themselves in the 1990s. Beginning with their acclaimed seventh album, <i>Achtung Baby</i> (1991), and the multimedia-intensive Zoo TV Tour, the band pursued a new musical direction influenced by alternative rock, electronic dance music, and industrial music, and they embraced a more ironic, flippant image. This experimentation continued through their ninth album, <i>Pop</i> (1997), and the PopMart Tour, which were mixed successes. U2 regained critical and commercial favour with the records <i>All That You Can't Leave Behind</i> (2000) and <i>How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb</i> (2004), which established a more conventional, mainstream sound for the group. Their U2 360° Tour of 2009–2011 set records for the highest-attended and highest-grossing concert tour, both of which were surpassed in 2019. The group most recently released the companion albums <i>Songs of Innocence</i> (2014) and <i>Songs of Experience</i> (2017), the former of which received criticism for its pervasive, no-cost release through the iTunes Store.
</p><p>U2 have released 14 studio albums and are one of the world's best-selling music artists, having sold an estimated 150–170 million records worldwide. They have won 22 Grammy Awards, more than any other band, and in 2005, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in their first year of eligibility. <i>Rolling Stone</i> ranked U2 at number 22 on its list of the ""100 Greatest Artists of All Time"". Throughout their career, as a band and as individuals, they have campaigned for human rights and social justice causes, including Amnesty International, Jubilee 2000, the ONE/DATA campaigns, Product Red, War Child, and Music Rising.

Originally an alternative hip hop group, they subsequently refashioned themselves as a more marketable pop-rap act. Although the group was founded in Los Angeles in 1995, it was not until the release of their third album <i>Elephunk</i> in 2003 that they achieved high record sales.
</p><p>The Black Eyed Peas' first major hit was the 2003 single ""Where Is the Love?"" from <i>Elephunk</i>, which topped the charts in 13 countries, including the United Kingdom, where it spent seven weeks at number one and went on to become Britain's biggest-selling single of 2003.

In 2009, the group became one of only 11 artists to have simultaneously held the number-one and number-two spots on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100, with their singles ""Boom Boom Pow"" and ""I Gotta Feeling"", which topped the chart for an unprecedented 26 consecutive weeks.
</p><p>The album <i>The E.N.D.</i> produced a third Hot 100 number-one placement with ""Imma Be"", making the group one of few to ever place three number one singles on the chart from the same album, before being followed with ""Rock That Body"" and ""Meet Me Halfway"", which peaked in the top 10 of the Hot 100. ""I Gotta Feeling"" became the first single to sell more than one million downloads in the United Kingdom. At the 52nd Grammy Awards ceremony, held in January 2010, they won three awards out of six nominations. In November 2010, they released the album <i>The Beginning</i>.

They were a leading group of the early-2000s indie rock revival.
</p><p>The release of their EP <i>The Modern Age</i> in early 2001 sparked a bidding war among major labels, with the band eventually signing to RCA Records. That summer, they released their debut album, <i>Is This It</i>, to critical acclaim and strong sales. It has since appeared on numerous ""best album"" lists. It was followed by <i>Room on Fire</i> (2003) and <i>First Impressions of Earth</i> (2005), both of which sold well but failed to match <i>Is This It</i> in critical success.
</p><p>Following a five-year hiatus, they released <i>Angles</i> (2011) to a generally positive reception, and <i>Comedown Machine</i> (2013) to lukewarm critical reception, both with dwindling sales.

When they signed to Geffen Records in 1986, the band comprised vocalist Axl Rose, lead guitarist Slash, rhythm guitarist Izzy Stradlin, bassist Duff McKagan, and drummer Steven Adler. The current lineup consists of Rose, Slash, McKagan, guitarist Richard Fortus, drummer Frank Ferrer and keyboardists Dizzy Reed and Melissa Reese.
</p><p>Guns N' Roses' debut album, <i>Appetite for Destruction</i> (1987), reached number one on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 a year after its release, on the strength of the top 10 singles ""Welcome to the Jungle"", ""Paradise City"", and ""Sweet Child o' Mine"", the band's only single to reach number one on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. The album has sold approximately 30 million copies worldwide, including 18 million units in the United States, making it the country's bestselling debut album and eleventh-bestselling album. Their next studio album, <i>G N' R Lies</i> (1988), reached number two on the <i>Billboard</i> 200, sold ten million copies worldwide (including five million in the U.S.), and included the top 5 hit ""Patience"". <i>Use Your Illusion I</i> and <i>Use Your Illusion II</i>, recorded simultaneously and released in 1991, debuted at number two and number one on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 respectively and have sold a combined 35 million copies worldwide (including 14 million units in the U.S.). The <i>Illusion</i> albums included the lead single ""You Could Be Mine"", covers of ""Live and Let Die"" and ""Knockin' on Heaven's Door"", and a trilogy of ballads (""Don't Cry"", ""November Rain"", and ""Estranged""), which featured notably high-budget music videos. The records were supported by the Use Your Illusion Tour, a world tour that lasted from 1991 to 1993. The covers album <i>""The Spaghetti Incident?""</i> (1993) was the last studio album to feature Slash and McKagan before their initial departure.
</p><p>Work on a follow-up album stalled due to creative differences between band members; by 1998 only Rose and Reed remained from the <i>Illusion</i>-era lineup. Rose, wanting to expand the band's sound with industrial and electronic elements, enrolled an eclectic lineup of musicians, including punk bassist Tommy Stinson, virtuoso guitarist Buckethead, synth player Chris Pitman and several touring members of Nine Inch Nails, among others. After a decade of work, Guns N' Roses's long-awaited sixth studio album, <i>Chinese Democracy</i> (2008), was released, featuring the title track as lead single. At an estimated $14 million in production costs, it is the most expensive rock album in history. It debuted at number three on the <i>Billboard</i> 200, but undersold industry expectations despite a mostly positive critical reception. Following the expansive Chinese Democracy Tour, Slash and McKagan rejoined the band in 2016 for the Not in This Lifetime... Tour, which became the third-highest-grossing concert tour on record, grossing over $584 million by its conclusion in 2019.
</p><p>In their early years, the band's hedonism and rebelliousness drew comparisons to the early Rolling Stones and earned them the nickname ""the most dangerous band in the world"". The band's classic lineup, along with later members Reed and drummer Matt Sorum, was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012, its first year of eligibility.

<p><b>The Doors</b> were an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1965, with vocalist Jim Morrison, keyboardist Ray Manzarek, guitarist Robby Krieger, and drummer John Densmore. They were among the most influential and controversial rock acts of the 1960s, partly due to Morrison's lyrics and voice, along with his erratic stage persona. The group is widely regarded as an important figure of the era's counterculture.</p><p>The band took its name from the title of Aldous Huxley's book <i>The Doors of Perception</i>, itself a reference to a quote by William Blake. After signing with Elektra Records in 1966, the Doors with Morrison recorded and released six studio albums in five years, some of which are generally considered among the greatest of all time, including their self-titled debut (1967), <i>Strange Days</i> (1967), and <i>L.A. Woman</i> (1971). They were one of the most successful bands during that time and by 1972 the Doors had sold over 4 million albums domestically and nearly 8 million singles.</p><p>Morrison died in uncertain circumstances in 1971. The band continued as a trio until disbanding in 1973. They released three more albums in the 1970s, one of which featured earlier recordings by Morrison, and over the decades reunited on stage in various configurations. In 2002, Manzarek, Krieger, and Ian Astbury of the Cult on vocals started performing as ""The Doors of the 21st Century"". Densmore and the Morrison estate successfully sued them over the use of the band's name. After a short time as Riders on the Storm, they settled on the name Manzarek–Krieger and toured until Manzarek's death in 2013.

They became a leading band of the progressive rock genre, cited by some as the greatest progressive rock band of all time.
</p><p>Pink Floyd were founded in 1965 by Syd Barrett (guitar, lead vocals), Nick Mason (drums), Roger Waters (bass guitar, vocals), and Richard Wright (keyboards, vocals). Under Barrett's leadership, they released two charting singles and the successful debut album <i>The Piper at the Gates of Dawn</i> (1967). Guitarist and vocalist David Gilmour joined in December 1967; Barrett left in April 1968 due to deteriorating mental health. Waters became the primary lyricist and thematic leader, devising the concepts behind the band's peak success with the albums <i>The Dark Side of the Moon</i> (1973), <i>Wish You Were Here</i> (1975), <i>Animals</i> (1977) and <i>The Wall</i> (1979). The musical film based on <i>The Wall</i>, <i>Pink Floyd – The Wall</i> (1982), won two BAFTA Awards. Pink Floyd also composed several film scores. 
</p><p>Following personal tensions, Wright left Pink Floyd in 1979, followed by Waters in 1985. Gilmour and Mason continued as Pink Floyd, rejoined later by Wright. They produced two more albums—<i>A Momentary Lapse of Reason</i> (1987) and <i>The Division Bell</i> (1994)—and toured in support of both before entering a long hiatus. In 2005, all but Barrett reunited for a one-off performance at the global awareness event Live 8. Barrett died in 2006, and Wright in 2008. The last Pink Floyd studio album, <i>The Endless River</i> (2014), was based on unreleased material from the <i>Division Bell</i> recording sessions. In 2022, Gilmour and Mason reformed Pink Floyd to release the song ""Hey, Hey, Rise Up!"" in protest of the Russo-Ukrainian War.

<p><b>Weezer</b> is an American rock band formed in Los Angeles, California, in 1992. Since 2001, the band has consisted of Rivers Cuomo (vocals, guitar, keyboards), Patrick Wilson (drums, backing vocals), Scott Shriner (bass guitar, keyboards, backing vocals), and Brian Bell (guitar, keyboards, backing vocals).
</p><p>After signing to Geffen Records in 1993, Weezer released their self-titled debut album, also known as the Blue Album, in May 1994. Backed by music videos for the singles ""Buddy Holly"", ""Undone – The Sweater Song"", and ""Say It Ain't So"", the Blue Album became a multiplatinum success. Weezer's second album, <i>Pinkerton</i> (1996), featuring a darker, more abrasive sound, was a commercial failure and initially received mixed reviews, but achieved cult status and critical acclaim years later. Both the Blue Album and <i>Pinkerton</i> are now frequently cited among the best albums of the 1990s. Following the tour for <i>Pinkerton</i>, founding bassist Matt Sharp left the band and Weezer went on hiatus.
</p><p>In 2001, Weezer returned with the Green Album with their new bassist, Mikey Welsh. With a more pop sound, and promoted by singles ""Hash Pipe"" and ""Island in the Sun"", it was a commercial success and received mostly positive reviews. After the Green Album tour, Welsh left for health reasons and was replaced by Shriner. Weezer's fourth album, <i>Maladroit</i> (2002), incorporated a hard-rock sound and achieved mostly positive reviews, but weaker sales. <i>Make Believe</i> (2005) received mixed reviews, but its single ""Beverly Hills"" became Weezer's first single to top the US Modern Rock Tracks chart and their first to reach the top ten on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100.
</p><p>In 2008, Weezer released the Red Album; its lead single, ""Pork and Beans"", became the third Weezer song to top the Modern Rock Tracks chart, backed by a Grammy-winning music video. <i>Raditude</i> (2009) and <i>Hurley</i> (2010) featured more ""modern pop production"" and songs co-written with other artists, achieved further mixed reviews and moderate sales. <i>Everything Will Be Alright in the End</i> (2014) and the White Album (2016) returned to a rock style that was reminiscent of their 90s sound mixed with modern alternative production and achieved more positive reviews; <i>Pacific Daydream</i> (2017) featured a more mainstream pop sound. In 2019, Weezer released an album of covers, the Teal Album, followed by the Black Album. In 2021, they released <i>OK Human</i>, which featured an orchestral pop sound and was met with critical acclaim, followed by the hard rock–inspired <i>Van Weezer</i>.

<p><b>Snow Patrol</b> are a Northern Irish–Scottish rock band formed in 1994 in Dundee, Scotland. They consist of Gary Lightbody (vocals, guitar), Nathan Connolly (guitar, backing vocals), Paul Wilson (bass guitar, backing vocals), Jonny Quinn (drums), and Johnny McDaid (piano, guitar, backing vocals). Initially an indie rock band, Snow Patrol rose to prominence in the early– mid-2000s as part of the post-Britpop movement.
</p><p>The band were founded at the University of Dundee in 1994 by Lightbody, Mark McClelland, and Michael Morrison of Shrug. After briefly using the name Polarbear, releasing the EP <i>Starfighter Pilot</i> (1997) and losing Morrison as a member, the band became Snow Patrol in 1997 and added Quinn to its lineup. Their first two studio albums, <i>Songs for Polarbears</i> (1998) and <i>When It's All Over We Still Have to Clear Up</i> (2001), released by the independent record label Jeepster Records, were commercially unsuccessful. The band then signed to the major record label Polydor Records in 2002.
</p><p>Connolly joined Snow Patrol in 2002, and after their major-label debut album, <i>Final Straw</i>, the following year, with ""Run"", the album's biggest hit, the band rose to national fame. The album was certified 5× platinum in the UK. Their next studio album, <i>Eyes Open</i> (2006), and its hit single, ""Chasing Cars""—reported in 2019 to be the most-played song of the 21st century on UK radio—propelled the band to greater international fame. The album topped the UK Albums Chart and was the best-selling British album of the year. In 2008, Snow Patrol released their fifth studio album, <i>A Hundred Million Suns</i>; then, in 2009, they released their first compilation album, <i>Up to Now</i>; and, in 2011, their sixth studio album, <i>Fallen Empires</i>, was published. The band released their seventh album, <i>Wildness</i>, on 25 May 2018.

</p>
<p><b>Blink-182</b> (stylized as <b>blink-182</b>) is an American rock band formed in Poway, California in 1992. Their current lineup consists of bassist/vocalist Mark Hoppus, guitarist/vocalist Tom DeLonge, and drummer Travis Barker. Though their sound has diversified throughout their career, their musical style, described as pop punk, blends catchy pop melodies with fast-paced punk rock. Their lyrics center on relationships, adolescent frustration, and maturity—or lack thereof. The group emerged from a suburban, Southern California skate-punk scene and gained notoriety for high-energy live shows and irreverent humor.
</p><p>After years of independent recording and touring, including stints on the Warped Tour, the group signed to MCA Records. Their biggest albums, <i>Enema of the State</i> (1999) and <i>Take Off Your Pants and Jacket</i> (2001), saw international success. Songs like ""All the Small Things"", ""Dammit"", ""I Miss You"", and ""What's My Age Again?"" became hit singles and MTV staples. Later efforts, including an untitled album (2003), marked stylistic shifts. Hoppus is the only member to remain in the band throughout its entire history. DeLonge left the group twice, both times a decade apart, before eventually returning. Founding drummer Scott Raynor recorded and toured with the group before being dismissed in 1998, with Barker taking his place from that point on. From 2015 to 2022, the band included Alkaline Trio singer/guitarist Matt Skiba, with whom they recorded two albums, <i>California</i> (2016) and <i>Nine</i> (2019) and toured in support of both.
</p><p>Blink-182's straightforward approach and simple arrangements, which helped initiate pop punk's mainstream rise, made them popular among generations of listeners. Worldwide, the group has sold 50 million albums and moved 13 million copies in the U.S.</p>"

<p><b>The White Stripes</b> were an American rock duo from Detroit formed in 1997. The group consisted of Jack White (songwriter, vocals, guitar, piano, and mandolin) and Meg White (drums and vocals). After releasing several singles and three albums within the Detroit music scene, the White Stripes rose to prominence in 2002 as part of the garage rock revival scene. Their successful and critically acclaimed albums <i>White Blood Cells</i> and <i>Elephant</i> drew attention from a large variety of media outlets in the United States and the United Kingdom. The single ""Seven Nation Army"", which used a guitar and an octave pedal to create the opening riff, became one of their most recognizable songs. The band recorded two more albums, <i>Get Behind Me Satan</i> in 2005 and <i>Icky Thump</i> in 2007, and dissolved in 2011 after a lengthy hiatus from performing and recording.</p><p>The White Stripes used a low-fidelity approach to writing and recording. Their music featured a melding of garage rock and blues influences and a raw simplicity of composition, arrangement, and performance. The duo were also noted for their fashion and design aesthetic which featured a simple color scheme of red, white, and black—which was used on every album and single cover the band released—as well as the band's fascination with the number three. The band's discography consists of six studio albums, two live albums, one extended play (EP), one concert film, one tour documentary, 26 singles, and 14 music videos. Their last three albums each won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album. In 2015, <i>Rolling Stone</i> named them the sixth greatest duo of all time.</p>"

</p>
<p><b>The Cure</b> are an English rock band formed in 1978 in Crawley, West Sussex. Throughout numerous lineup changes since the band's formation, guitarist, lead vocalist, and songwriter Robert Smith has remained the only constant member. The band's debut album, <i>Three Imaginary Boys</i> (1979), along with several early singles, placed the band in the post-punk and new wave movements that had sprung up in the United Kingdom. Beginning with their second album, <i>Seventeen Seconds</i> (1980), the band adopted a new, increasingly dark and tormented style, which, together with Smith's stage look, had a strong influence on the emerging genre of gothic rock as well as the subculture that eventually formed around the genre.
</p><p>After the release of the band's fourth album, <i>Pornography</i> (1982), Smith introduced a greater pop sensibility into the band's music, and they subsequently garnered worldwide mainstream success. Their singles compilation <i>Standing on a Beach</i> (1986) sold four million copies worldwide by 1989, and they reached their commercial peak with the albums <i>Disintegration</i> (1989) and <i>Wish</i> (1992). The Cure have released 13 studio albums, two EPs, over 30 singles, and have sold over 30 million albums worldwide. Their most recent album, <i>4:13 Dream</i>, was released in 2008.

</p>
<p><b>Led Zeppelin</b> were  an English rock band formed in London in 1968. The group comprised vocalist Robert Plant, guitarist Jimmy Page, bassist/keyboardist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. With a heavy, guitar-driven sound, they are cited as one of the progenitors of hard rock and heavy metal, although their style drew from a variety of influences, including blues and folk music. Led Zeppelin have been credited as significantly impacting the nature of the music industry, particularly in the development of album-oriented rock (AOR) and stadium rock.
</p><p>Originally named the New Yardbirds, Led Zeppelin signed a deal with Atlantic Records that gave them considerable artistic freedom. Initially unpopular with critics, they achieved significant commercial success with eight studio albums over ten years. Their 1969 debut, <i>Led Zeppelin</i>, was a top-ten album in several countries and featured such tracks as ""Good Times Bad Times"", ""Dazed and Confused"" and ""Communication Breakdown"". <i>Led Zeppelin II</i> (1969) was their first number-one album, and yielded ""Ramble On"" and ""Whole Lotta Love"". In 1970, they released <i>Led Zeppelin III</i> which featured ""Immigrant Song"". Their untitled fourth album, commonly known as <i>Led Zeppelin IV</i> (1971), is one of the best-selling albums in history with 37 million copies sold. The album includes ""Black Dog"", ""Rock and Roll"" and ""Stairway to Heaven"", with the latter being among the most popular and influential works in rock history. <i>Houses of the Holy</i> (1973) yielded ""The Ocean"", ""Over the Hills and Far Away"" and ""The Rain Song"". <i>Physical Graffiti</i> (1975), a double album, featured ""Trampled Under Foot"" and ""Kashmir"".
</p><p>Page wrote most of Led Zeppelin's music, particularly early in their career, while Plant wrote most of the lyrics. Jones's keyboard-based compositions later became central to their music, which featured increasing experimentation. The latter half of their career saw a series of record-breaking tours that earned the group a reputation for excess and debauchery. Although they remained commercially and critically successful, their touring and output, which included <i>Presence</i> (1976) and <i>In Through the Out Door</i> (1979), grew limited, and the group disbanded following Bonham's death in 1980. Since then, the surviving former members have sporadically collaborated and participated in one-off reunions. The most successful of these was the 2007 Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert in London, with Bonham's son Jason Bonham on drums.
</p><p>Led Zeppelin are one of the best-selling music artists of all time; their total record sales are estimated to be between 200 and 300 million units worldwide. They achieved eight consecutive UK number-one albums and six number-one albums on the US <i>Billboard</i> 200, with five of their albums certified Diamond in the US. <i>Rolling Stone</i> magazine described them as ""the heaviest band of all time"", ""the biggest band of the Seventies"", and ""unquestionably one of the most enduring bands in rock history"". They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995; the museum's biography of the band states that they were ""as influential"" during the 1970s as the Beatles were during the 1960s.</p>"

</p>
<p><b>Aerosmith</b> is an American rock band formed in Boston in 1970. The group consists of Steven Tyler (lead vocals), Joe Perry (guitar), Tom Hamilton (bass), Joey Kramer (drums) and Brad Whitford (guitar). Their style, which is rooted in blues-based hard rock, has also incorporated elements of pop rock, heavy metal, glam metal, and rhythm and blues, and has inspired many subsequent rock artists. They are sometimes referred to as ""the Bad Boys from Boston"" and ""America's Greatest Rock and Roll Band"". The primary songwriting team of Tyler and Perry is often known as the ""Toxic Twins"".
</p><p>Perry and Hamilton, originally in a band together called the Jam Band, met up with Tyler, Kramer, and guitarist Ray Tabano, and formed Aerosmith; in 1971, Tabano was replaced by Whitford. They released a string of multi-platinum albums starting with their eponymous debut in 1973, followed by <i>Get Your Wings</i> in 1974. The band broke into the mainstream with <i>Toys in the Attic</i> (1975) and <i>Rocks</i> (1976). <i>Draw the Line</i> and <i>Night in the Ruts</i> followed in 1977 and 1979. Throughout the 1970s, the band toured extensively and charted a dozen Hot 100 singles, including their first Top 40 hit ""Sweet Emotion"" and the Top 10 hits ""Dream On"" and ""Walk This Way"". By the end of the decade, they were among the most popular hard rock bands in the world and developed a following of fans, often referred to as the ""Blue Army"". Drug addiction and internal conflict led to the departures of Perry and Whitford in 1979 and 1981.
The band did not fare well and the album <i>Rock in a Hard Place</i> (1982) failed to match previous successes.
</p><p>Perry and Whitford returned to Aerosmith in 1984. After a comeback tour, they recorded <i>Done with Mirrors</i> (1985), which did not meet commercial expectations. It was not until a 1986 collaboration with rap group Run–D.M.C. on a remake of ""Walk This Way"", and the 1987 multi-platinum release, <i>Permanent Vacation</i>, that they regained their previous level of popularity. In the late 1980s and 1990s, the band won numerous awards for music from the multi-platinum albums <i>Pump</i> (1989), <i>Get a Grip</i> (1993), and <i>Nine Lives</i> (1997), while they embarked on their most extensive concert tours to date. Their biggest hits during this period included ""Dude (Looks Like a Lady)"", ""Angel"", ""Rag Doll"", ""Love in an Elevator"", ""Janie's Got a Gun"", ""What it Takes"", ""Livin' on the Edge"", ""Cryin'"", and ""Crazy"". The band also filmed popular music videos and made notable appearances in television, film, and video games. In 1998, they achieved their first number-one hit with ""I Don't Want to Miss a Thing"" from <i>Armageddon'</i>s soundtrack and the following year, their roller coaster attraction opened at Walt Disney World. Their comeback has been described as one of the most remarkable and spectacular in rock history. Additional albums <i>Just Push Play</i> (which included the hit ""Jaded""), <i>Honkin' on Bobo</i> (a collection of blues covers), and <i>Music from Another Dimension!</i> followed in 2001, 2004, and 2012. In 2008, they released <i>Guitar Hero: Aerosmith</i>, which is considered to be the best-selling band-centric video game. After five decades, the band continues to tour and record music. From 2019–2022, the band had a concert residency in Las Vegas, which was interrupted from 2020–2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
</p><p>Aerosmith is the best-selling American hard rock band of all time, having sold more than 150 million records worldwide, including over 85 million records in the United States. With 25 gold, 18 platinum, and 12 multi-platinum albums, they hold the record for the most total certifications by an American group and are tied for the most multi-platinum albums by an American group. They have achieved twenty-one Top 40 hits on the US Hot 100, nine number-one Mainstream Rock hits, four Grammy Awards, six American Music Awards, and ten MTV Video Music Awards. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001, and were ranked number 57 and 30, respectively, on <i>Rolling Stone</i><span>'</span>s and VH1's lists of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. In 2013, Tyler and Perry were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and in 2020, the band received the MusiCares Person of the Year award.

Over the course of their <span></span>39-year career, the Offspring has released ten studio albums and have also experienced a number of lineup changes, most notably with their drummer. Their longest-serving drummer was Ron Welty, who replaced original drummer James Lilja in 1987 and stayed with the Offspring for 16 years. Welty was replaced by Atom Willard in 2003, who was replaced four years later by Pete Parada, who remained as the drummer for the Offspring until 2021. Gregory ""Greg K."" Kriesel (one of the Offspring's cofounders) was their bassist until 2018, when he was fired from the band due to business disputes, thus leaving Holland as the sole remaining original member. Kriesel was replaced by Todd Morse of H<sub>2</sub>O, who had been the Offspring's touring guitarist since 2009.</p><p>The Offspring is often credited—alongside fellow California punk bands Green Day, NOFX, Bad Religion and Rancid—for reviving mainstream interest in punk rock in the 1990s. They have sold over 40 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling punk rock bands in history.</p><p>After achieving a local following with their early releases, including their 1989 self-titled debut album and the vinyl-only EP <i>Baghdad</i> (1991), the Offspring signed with independent label Epitaph Records and released two albums: <i>Ignition</i> (1992) and <i>Smash</i> (1994). <i>Smash</i>, which contained the band's first major hit ""Come Out and Play"", propelled punk rock into the mainstream and holds the distinction as one of the best-selling albums released on an independent record label, selling over 11 million copies worldwide. The success of <i>Smash</i> attracted attention from major labels including Columbia Records, with whom The Offspring signed in 1996; their first album for the label, <i>Ixnay on the Hombre</i> (1997), did not match its predecessor’s success, but received favorable reviews and gold and platinum RIAA certifications. The band's fifth album <i>Americana</i> (1998) regained their previous level of popularity, obtaining support from MTV and radio and selling over five million units in the US.

Metallica,,1981–present,Metallica,"<p class=""mw-empty-elt"">



</p>
<p><b>Metallica</b> is an American heavy metal band. The band was formed in 1981 in Los Angeles by vocalist/guitarist James Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich, and has been based in San Francisco for most of its career. The band's fast tempos, instrumentals and aggressive musicianship made them one of the founding ""big four"" bands of thrash metal, alongside Megadeth, Anthrax and Slayer. Metallica's current lineup comprises founding members and primary songwriters Hetfield and Ulrich, longtime lead guitarist Kirk Hammett and bassist Robert Trujillo. Guitarist Dave Mustaine, who formed Megadeth after being fired from the band, and bassists Ron McGovney, Cliff Burton and Jason Newsted are former members of the band.
</p><p>Metallica first found commercial success with the release of its third album, <i>Master of Puppets</i> (1986), which is cited as one of the heaviest metal albums and the band's best work. The band's next album, <i>...And Justice for All</i> (1988), gave Metallica its first Grammy Award nomination. Its self-titled fifth album, <i>Metallica</i> (1991), was the band's first not to root predominantly in thrash metal; it appealed to a more mainstream audience, achieving substantial commercial success and selling over 16 million copies in the United States to date, making it the best-selling album of the SoundScan era. After experimenting with different genres and directions in subsequent releases, Metallica returned to its thrash metal roots with the release of its ninth album, <i>Death Magnetic</i> (2008), which drew similar praise to that of the band's earlier albums. This was followed by the band's 10th studio album, <i>Hardwired... to Self-Destruct</i> (2016), with its 11th album, <i>72 Seasons</i>, set for release in 2023.
</p><p>In 2000, Metallica led the case against the peer-to-peer file sharing service Napster, in which the band and several other artists filed lawsuits against the service for sharing their copyright-protected material without consent, eventually reaching a settlement. Metallica was the subject of the acclaimed 2004 documentary film <i>Metallica: Some Kind of Monster</i>, which documented the troubled production of the band's eighth album, <i>St. Anger</i> (2003), and the internal struggles within the band at the time. In 2009, Metallica was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The band co-wrote the screenplay for and starred alongside Dane DeHaan in the 2013 concert film <i>Metallica: Through the Never</i>, in which the band performed live against a fictional thriller storyline.
</p><p>Metallica has released 10 studio albums, four live albums (including two performances with the San Francisco Symphony), 12 video albums, a cover album, two extended plays, 37 singles and 39 music videos. The band has won nine Grammy Awards from 23 nominations, and its last six studio albums (beginning with <i>Metallica</i>) have consecutively debuted at No. 1 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200. Metallica ranks as one of the most commercially successful bands of all time, having sold over 125 million albums worldwide as of 2018. Metallica has been listed as one of the greatest artists of all time by magazines such as <i>Rolling Stone</i>, which ranked the band No. 61 on its <i>100 Greatest Artists of All Time</i> list. As of 2017, Metallica is the third-best-selling music artist since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales in 1991, selling a total of 58 million albums in the United States.</p>"
R.E.M.,Athens,1980–2011,R.E.M.,"<p><b>R.E.M.</b> was an American rock band from Athens, Georgia, formed in 1980 by drummer Bill Berry, guitarist Peter Buck, bassist Mike Mills, and lead vocalist Michael Stipe, who were students at the University of Georgia. One of the first alternative rock bands, R.E.M. was noted for Buck's ringing, arpeggiated guitar style; Stipe's distinctive vocal quality, unique stage presence, and obscure lyrics; Mills's melodic bass lines and backing vocals; and Berry's tight, economical drumming style. In the early 1990s, other alternative rock acts such as Nirvana and Pavement viewed R.E.M. as a pioneer of the genre. After Berry left the band in 1997, the band continued its career in the 2000s with mixed critical and commercial success. The band broke up amicably in 2011 with members devoting time to solo projects after having sold more than 90 million albums worldwide and becoming one of the world's best-selling music acts.
</p><p>R.E.M. released its first single, ""Radio Free Europe"", in 1981 on the independent record label Hib-Tone. It was followed by the <i>Chronic Town</i> EP in 1982, the band's first release on I.R.S. Records. In 1983, the group released its critically acclaimed debut album, <i>Murmur</i>, and built its reputation over the next few years with similarly acclaimed releases every year from 1984 to 1988: <i>Reckoning</i>, <i>Fables of the Reconstruction</i>, <i>Lifes Rich Pageant</i>, <i>Document</i> and <i>Green</i>, including an intermittent b-side compilation <i>Dead Letter Office</i>. Don Dixon and Mitch Easter produced their first two albums, Joe Boyd handled production on <i>Fables of the Reconstruction</i> and Don Gehman produced <i>Lifes Rich Pageant.</i> Thereafter, R.E.M. settled on Scott Litt as producer for the next 10<span> </span>years during the band's most successful period of their career. They also started co-producing their material and playing other instruments in the studio apart from the main ones they play. With constant touring, and the support of college radio following years of underground success, R.E.M. achieved a mainstream hit with the 1987 single ""The One I Love"". The group signed to Warner Bros. Records in 1988, and began to espouse political and environmental concerns while playing large arenas worldwide.
</p><p>R.E.M.'s most commercially successful albums, <i>Out of Time</i> (1991) and <i>Automatic for the People</i> (1992), put them in the vanguard of alternative rock just as it was becoming mainstream. <i>Out of Time</i> received seven nominations at the 34th Annual Grammy Awards, and lead single ""Losing My Religion"", was R.E.M.'s highest-charting and best-selling hit. <i>Monster</i> (1994) continued its run of success. The band began its first tour in six years to support the album; the tour was marred by medical emergencies suffered by three of the band members. In 1996, R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. for a reported US$80 million, at the time the most expensive recording contract ever. The tour was productive and the band recorded the following album mostly during soundchecks. The resulting record, <i>New Adventures in Hi-Fi</i> (1996), is hailed as the band's last great album and the members' favorite, growing in cult status over the years. Berry left the band the following year, and Stipe, Buck, and Mills continued as a musical trio, supplemented by studio and live musicians, such as multi-instrumentalists Scott McCaughey and Ken Stringfellow and drummers Joey Waronker and Bill Rieflin. They also parted ways with their longtime manager Jefferson Holt and band's attorney Bertis Downs assumed managerial duties. Seeking to also renovate their sound, the band stopped working with Scott Litt, co-producer and contributor to six of their studio albums and hired Pat McCarthy as co-producer, who had participated before that as mixer and engineer on their last two albums.
</p><p>After the electronic experimental direction of <i>Up</i> (1998) that was commercially unsuccessful, <i>Reveal</i> (2001) was referred to as ""a conscious return to their classic sound"" which received general acclaim. In 2007, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, in its first year of eligibility and Berry reunited with the band for the ceremony and to record a cover of John Lennon's ""#9 Dream"" for the compilation album <i>Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur</i> to benefit Amnesty International's campaign to alleviate the Darfur conflict. Looking for a change of sound after lukewarm reception for <i>Around the Sun</i> (2004), the band collaborated with co-producer Jacknife Lee on their last two studio albums—the well-received <i>Accelerate</i> (2008) and <i>Collapse into Now</i> (2011)—as well as their first live albums after decades of touring. R.E.M. disbanded amicably in September 2011, with former members having continued with various musical projects, and several live and archival albums have since been released.

<p><b>Rage Against the Machine</b> (often abbreviated as <b>RATM</b> or shortened to simply <b>Rage</b>) is an American rock band from Los Angeles, California. Formed in 1991, the group consists of vocalist Zack de la Rocha, bassist and backing vocalist Tim Commerford, guitarist Tom Morello, and drummer Brad Wilk. The band are known for their melding of heavy metal and rap music with punk rock and funk influences, and their revolutionary socialist political views. As of 2010, they have sold over 16 million records worldwide. The band was nominated for induction into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in their first year of eligibility in 2017, then again in 2018, 2019, and 2021, though the bids failed.</p><p>Rage Against the Machine released its self-titled debut album in 1992 to critical acclaim, and achieved commercial success following their performances at the 1993 Lollapalooza festival; in 2003, the album was ranked number 368 on <i>Rolling Stone's</i> list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. The band's next two albums, <i>Evil Empire</i> (1996) and <i>The Battle of Los Angeles</i> (1999), were also successful; both albums topped the <i>Billboard</i> 200 chart. During their initial nine-year run, Rage Against the Machine became a popular and influential band, and had a large influence on the nu metal genre which came to prominence during the late 1990s and early 2000s. They were also ranked No. 33 on VH1's <i>100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock</i>.</p><p>In 2000, Rage Against the Machine released the cover album <i>Renegades</i> and disbanded after growing creative differences led to De la Rocha's departure. De la Rocha started a low-profile solo career, while the rest of the band formed the rock supergroup Audioslave with Chris Cornell, the former frontman of Soundgarden; Audioslave recorded three albums before disbanding in 2007. The same year, Rage Against the Machine announced a reunion and performed together for the first time in seven years at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in April 2007. Within the next four years, minus a sabbatical in 2009, the band continued to perform at more live venues and festivals around the world before going on hiatus once again in 2011. In 2016, Morello, Commerford and Wilk formed a new band, Prophets of Rage, with B-Real, Chuck D, and DJ Lord; that band released one EP and one full-length studio album before disbanding in 2019.
</p><p>After an eight-year hiatus, Rage Against the Machine announced in November 2019 that they were reuniting for a world tour, which was initially scheduled to start in 2020, but was ultimately postponed to 2021, and then to 2022, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

</p><p>Nickelback is one of the most commercially successful Canadian rock bands, having sold more than 50 million albums worldwide. In 2009, <i>Billboard</i> ranked it the most successful rock group and the seventh-most successful artist of that decade; ""How You Remind Me"" was the best-selling rock song and the fourth-best overall.

</p>
<p><b>The Smashing Pumpkins</b> (also referred to as simply <b>Smashing Pumpkins</b>) are an American alternative rock band from Chicago. Formed in 1988 by frontman and guitarist Billy Corgan, bassist D'arcy Wretzky, guitarist  James Iha and drummer Jimmy Chamberlin, the band has undergone several line-up changes since their reunion in 2006, with Corgan being the sole constant member since its inception. The current lineup features Corgan, Chamberlin, Iha and guitarist Jeff Schroeder.
</p><p>Disavowing the punk rock roots of many of their contemporaries, they have a diverse, densely-layered sound, containing elements of gothic rock, heavy metal, dream pop, psychedelic rock, progressive rock, shoegaze, and electronica in later recordings. Corgan is the group's primary composer; his musical versatility and cathartic lyrics have shaped the band's distinctive albums, which one writer described as ""anguished, bruised reports from Billy Corgan's nightmare-land"". With 30 million albums sold worldwide, the Smashing Pumpkins were one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands of the 1990s, often cited as an important act in the popularization of alternative rock music. However, internal conflicts, drug use, and diminishing sales led to a break-up in 2000.
</p><p>In 2006, Corgan and Chamberlin reconvened to record a new Smashing Pumpkins album, <i>Zeitgeist</i>. After touring throughout 2007 and 2008 with a lineup including new guitarist Jeff Schroeder, Chamberlin left the band in early 2009. Later that year, Corgan began a new recording series with a rotating lineup of musicians entitled <i>Teargarden by Kaleidyscope</i>, which encompassed stand-alone singles, EP releases, and two full albums that also fell under the project's scope—<i>Oceania</i> in 2012 and <i>Monuments to an Elegy</i> in 2014. Chamberlin and Iha officially rejoined the band in February 2018. The reunited lineup released the album <i>Shiny and Oh So Bright, Vol. 1 / LP: No Past. No Future. No Sun.</i> (2018),  <i>Cyr</i> (2020) and is scheduled to release <i>Atum: A Rock Opera in Three Acts</i> in three increments across 2022 and 2023.

The Who,,,The Who,"<p class=""mw-empty-elt"">


</p>
<p><b>The Who</b> are an English rock band formed in London in 1964. Their core lineup consisted of lead vocalist Roger Daltrey, guitarist Pete Townshend, bassist John Entwistle and drummer Keith Moon. They are considered one of the most influential rock bands of the 20th century, and have sold over 100 million records worldwide. Their contributions to rock music include the development of the Marshall Stack, large PA systems, the use of the synthesizer, Entwistle and Moon's influential playing styles, Townshend's feedback and power chord guitar technique, and the development of the rock opera. They are cited as an influence by many hard rock, punk, power pop and mod bands, and their songs are still regularly played. The Who were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990. 
</p><p>The Who developed from an earlier group, the Detours, and established themselves as part of the pop art and mod movements, featuring auto-destructive art by destroying guitars and drums on stage. Their first single as the Who, ""I Can't Explain"" (1965), reached the UK top ten, and was followed by a string of hit singles including ""My Generation"" (1965), ""Substitute"" (1966) and ""Happy Jack"" (1966). In 1967, they performed at the Monterey Pop Festival and released ""I Can See for Miles"", their only US top-ten single. The group's 1969 concept album <i>Tommy</i> included the single ""Pinball Wizard"" and was a critical and commercial success.
</p><p>Further festival appearances at Woodstock and the Isle of Wight, along with the concert album <i>Live at Leeds</i> (1970), established their reputation as a respected rock act. The success put pressure on lead songwriter Townshend, and the follow-up to <i>Tommy</i>, <i>Lifehouse</i>, was abandoned. Songs from the project made up <i>Who's Next</i> (1971), including the hits ""Won't Get Fooled Again"", ""Baba O'Riley"", and ""Behind Blue Eyes"". The group released another concept album, <i>Quadrophenia</i> (1973), as a celebration of their mod roots, and oversaw the film adaptation of <i>Tommy</i> (1975). They continued to tour to large audiences before semi-retiring from live performances at the end of 1976. The release of <i>Who Are You</i> (1978) was overshadowed by Moon's death shortly after.
</p><p>Kenney Jones replaced Moon and the group resumed touring, and released a film adaptation of <i>Quadrophenia</i> and the retrospective documentary <i>The Kids Are Alright</i>. After Townshend became weary of the group, they split in 1983. The Who occasionally re-formed for live appearances such as Live Aid in 1985, a 25th-anniversary tour in 1989 and a tour of <i>Quadrophenia</i> in 1996–1997. A full reunion began in 1999, with drummer Zak Starkey. After Entwistle's death in 2002, plans for a new album were delayed until 2006, with <i>Endless Wire</i>.  Since Entwistle's death, the Who have continued to perform and tour, most commonly with Starkey on drums, Pino Palladino on bass, and Pete's brother Simon Townshend on second guitar and backing vocals. In 2019, the group released the album <i>Who</i> and toured with a symphony orchestra.

<p><b>Fall Out Boy</b> is an American rock band formed in Wilmette, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, in 2001. The band consists of lead vocalist and guitarist Patrick Stump, bassist Pete Wentz, drummer Andy Hurley, and guitarist Joe Trohman. The band originated from Chicago's hardcore punk scene and was formed by Wentz and Trohman as a pop punk side project; Stump joined shortly thereafter. The group went through a succession of drummers before Hurley joined. Their debut album, <i>Take This to Your Grave</i> (2003), became an underground success and helped the band gain a dedicated fanbase through heavy touring. <i>Take This to Your Grave</i> is cited as influential on pop punk music in the 2000s.
</p><p>With Wentz as the band's lyricist and Stump as the primary composer, Fall Out Boy's 2005 major-label breakthrough, <i>From Under the Cork Tree</i>, produced two hit singles, ""Sugar, We're Goin Down"" and ""Dance, Dance"".

Fall Out Boy received a Best New Artist nomination at the 2006 Grammy Awards. <i>Infinity on High</i> (2007) debuted at number one on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 with 260,000 first week sales. It produced two worldwide hit singles, ""This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race"" and ""Thnks fr th Mmrs"". <i>Folie à Deux (2008)</i>, was a commercial disappointment and received a mixed response. Following the release of <i>Believers Never Die – Greatest Hits</i> in 2009, the band went on hiatus and the members worked on side projects.
</p><p><i>Save Rock and Roll</i> (2013) became Fall Out Boy's second number-one album, and included the top 20 single ""My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark (Light Em Up)"".

The band's sixth studio album, <i>American Beauty/American Psycho</i> (2015) peaked at number one on the <i>Billboard</i> 200, and spawned the top-10 hit ""Centuries"" and the single ""Uma Thurman"" which reached No. 22 on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. This was followed by their first remix album <i>Make America Psycho Again</i>, which featured the remixes of all original tracks from <i>American Beauty/American Psycho</i> by a different artist on each song, including Migos and Wiz Khalifa.
</p><p>The band's seventh studio album <i>Mania</i> (2018), also peaked at No. 1, making it the band's fourth No. 1 album and sixth consecutive top 10 album. The Mania tour included a show at Wrigley Field, their first headlining stadium show. In 2018, Fall Out Boy also received their second Grammy nomination for Best Rock Album for <i>Mania</i>. On January 18, 2023, the group announced its eighth studio album, <i>So Much (for) Stardust</i>, which is set for release on March 24.

<p><b>AC/DC</b> (stylised as <b>ACϟDC</b>) are an Australian rock band formed in Sydney in 1973 by Scottish-born Australian brothers Malcolm (rhythm guitar) and Angus Young (lead guitar). Their music has been variously described as hard rock, blues rock, and heavy metal, but the band calls it simply ""rock and roll"".</p><p>AC/DC underwent several line-up changes before releasing their first album, <i>High Voltage</i> (1975). Membership subsequently stabilised around the Young brothers with fellow Scottish-born Australian Bon Scott (lead vocals) alongside native Australians Mark Evans (bass) and Phil Rudd (drums). Evans was fired from the band in 1977 and replaced by Cliff Williams, who has since appeared on every album since <i>Powerage</i> (1978). Seven months after the release of the band's breakthrough album <i>Highway to Hell</i> (1979), Scott died of alcohol poisoning and the other members considered disbanding. However, at the request of Scott's parents, they continued together and recruited English singer Brian Johnson as their new frontman. Their first album with Johnson, <i>Back in Black</i> (1980), was dedicated to Scott's memory. It was a widespread success, launching the band to new heights and becoming the second best-selling album of all time.
</p><p>The band's eighth studio album, <i>For Those About to Rock</i> (1981), was their first album to reach number one in the United States. Prior to the release of their next album, <i>Flick of the Switch</i> (1983), Rudd left the band and was replaced by Simon Wright, who was himself replaced by Chris Slade six years later. The band experienced a commercial resurgence in the early 1990s with the release of their 12th studio album <i>The Razors Edge</i> (1990); it was their only album to feature Slade, who was replaced by the returning Rudd in 1994. Rudd has since recorded five more albums with the band, starting with <i>Ballbreaker</i> (1995). Their 15th studio album <i>Black Ice</i> was the second-highest-selling album of 2008 and their biggest chart hit since <i>For Those About to Rock</i>, eventually reaching No. 1 worldwide.</p><p>The band's line-up remained the same for 20 years until 2014, when Malcolm Young retired due to early-onset dementia (from which he died three years later) and Rudd became involved in legal troubles. Malcolm was replaced by his nephew Stevie Young, who debuted on the album <i>Rock or Bust</i> (2014). On the accompanying tour, previous drummer Chris Slade filled in for Rudd. In 2016, Johnson was advised to stop touring due to worsening hearing loss, and ex-Guns N' Roses singer Axl Rose stepped in as the band's frontman for the remainder of that year's dates. Long-time bassist and backing vocalist Williams retired at the end of the <i>Rock or Bust</i> tour in 2016, and the group entered a four-year hiatus. A reunion of the <i>Rock or Bust</i> line-up was announced in September 2020, and the band's 17th studio album <i>Power Up</i> was released two months later.

A highlight of this era was the band's June 1988 concert at the Pasadena Rose Bowl, where they drew a crowd in excess of 60,000 people. In early 1990, they released <i>Violator</i>, an international mainstream success. The following album <i>Songs of Faith and Devotion</i>, released in 1993, was also a success, though the band's internal struggles during recording and touring resulted in Wilder's departure in 1995.

</p>
<p><b>Bob Dylan</b> (legally <b>Robert Dylan</b>, born <b>Robert Allen Zimmerman</b>, May 24, 1941) is an American singer-songwriter. Often regarded as one of the greatest songwriters of all time, Dylan has been a major figure in popular culture during a career spanning more than 60 years. Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s, when songs such as ""Blowin' in the Wind"" (1963) and ""The Times They Are a-Changin'<span>""</span> (1964) became anthems for the civil rights and antiwar movements. His lyrics during this period incorporated a range of political, social, philosophical, and literary influences, defying pop music conventions and appealing to the burgeoning counterculture.</p><p>Following his self-titled debut album in 1962, which comprised mainly traditional folk songs, Dylan made his breakthrough as a songwriter with the release of <i>The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan</i> the following year. The album features ""Blowin' in the Wind"" and the thematically complex ""A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall"". Many of his songs adapted the tunes and phraseology of older folk songs. He went on to release the politically charged <i>The Times They Are a-Changin'</i> and the more lyrically abstract and introspective <i>Another Side of Bob Dylan</i> in 1964. In 1965 and 1966, Dylan drew controversy among folk purists when he adopted electrically amplified rock instrumentation, and in the space of 15 months recorded three of the most important and influential rock albums of the 1960s: <i>Bringing It All Back Home</i>, <i>Highway 61 Revisited</i> (both 1965) and <i>Blonde on Blonde</i> (1966). His six-minute single ""Like a Rolling Stone"" (1965) expanded commercial and creative boundaries in popular music.</p><p>In July 1966, a motorcycle accident led to Dylan's withdrawal from touring. During this period, he recorded a large body of songs with members of the Band, who had previously backed him on tour. These recordings were released as the collaborative album <i>The Basement Tapes</i> in 1975. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Dylan explored country music and rural themes in <i>John Wesley Harding</i> (1967), <i>Nashville Skyline</i> (1969), and <i>New Morning</i> (1970). In 1975, he released <i>Blood on the Tracks</i>, which many saw as a return to form. In the late 1970s, he became a born-again Christian and released a series of albums of contemporary gospel music before returning to his more familiar rock-based idiom in the early 1980s. Dylan's 1997 album <i>Time Out of Mind</i> marked the beginning of a renaissance for his career. He has released five critically acclaimed albums of original material since then, the most recent being <i>Rough and Rowdy Ways</i> (2020). He also recorded a series of three albums in the 2010s comprising versions of traditional American standards, especially songs recorded by Frank Sinatra. Dylan has toured continuously since the late 1980s on what has become known as the Never Ending Tour.</p><p>Since 1994, Dylan has published nine books of drawings and paintings, and his work has been exhibited in major art galleries. He has sold more than 125 million records, making him one of the best-selling musicians of all time. He has received numerous awards, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom, ten Grammy Awards, a Golden Globe Award and an Academy Award. Dylan has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame. The Pulitzer Prize Board in 2008 awarded him a special citation for ""his profound impact on popular music and American culture, marked by lyrical compositions of extraordinary poetic power"". In 2016, Dylan was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature ""for having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition"".</p>

</p>

<p><b>John Clayton Mayer</b> (<span></span> <i title=""English pronunciation respelling""><span>MAY</span>-ər</i>; born October 16, 1977) is an American singer, songwriter, and guitarist. Born and raised in Fairfield County, Connecticut, Mayer attended Berklee College of Music in Boston, but left   and moved to Atlanta in 1997 with Clay Cook. Together, they formed a short-lived two-man band called Lo-Fi Masters. After their split, Mayer continued to play local clubs, refining his skills and gaining a following. After his appearance at the 2001 South by Southwest festival, he was signed to Aware Records, and eventually to Columbia Records, which released his first extended play <i>Inside Wants Out</i>. His following two studio albums—<i>Room for Squares</i> (2001) and <i>Heavier Things</i> (2003)—performed well commercially, achieving multi-platinum status. In 2003, he won the Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for his single ""Your Body Is a Wonderland"".
</p><p>By 2005, Mayer had moved away from the acoustic music that characterized his early records, and begun performing the blues and rock music that had originally influenced him as a musician. He collaborated with blues artists such as B.B. King, Buddy Guy, and Eric Clapton. Forming the John Mayer Trio, he released a live album, <i>Try!</i>, in 2005 and his third studio album <i>Continuum</i> in 2006. Both albums received positive reviews, and <i>Continuum</i> earned Mayer a 2007 Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album. He also won Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for ""Waiting on the World to Change"". That album was followed by <i>Battle Studies</i> in 2009, a return to pop, with a Battle Studies World Tour.
</p><p>After having several controversial incidents with the media, Mayer withdrew from public life in 2010 and began work on his fifth studio album, <i>Born and Raised</i>, which drew inspiration from the 1970s pop music of Laurel Canyon. However, the discovery of a granuloma on his vocal cords delayed the release of the album until May 2012, and forced him to cancel the planned tour. The album received a generally favorable reception, though was less commercially successful than his previous work. Mayer began performing as a singer again in January 2013, and that year released his sixth studio album, <i>Paradise Valley</i>, which incorporates country music influences. By 2014, he had sold a total of over 20 million albums worldwide. His seventh album, <i>The Search for Everything</i>, a loose concept album based around the theme of a romantic break-up, was released in 2017. Mayer released his latest album, <i>Sob Rock</i>, inspired by 1980s soft rock music, in July 2021.
</p><p>In 2015, three former members of the Grateful Dead joined with Mayer and two other musicians to form the band Dead &amp; Company. It is the latest of several reunions of the band's surviving members since Jerry Garcia's death in 1995. The band remains active and its tours have been well received.</p><p>Mayer's secondary career pursuits extend to television hosting, comedy, and writing; he has authored columns for magazines such as <i>Esquire</i>. He supports various causes and has performed at charity benefits. He is a watch aficionado (with a collection he values in the ""tens of millions"" of dollars), contributing to the watch site <i>Hodinkee</i>, and has been on the jury at the <i>Grand Prix d'Horlogerie de Genève</i>.</p>

Black Sabbath,Birmingham,"1968–2017 {{small|(hiatuses 1985, 1996–1997, 2006–2011)",Black Sabbath,"<p class=""mw-empty-elt"">



</p>
<p><b>Black Sabbath</b> were an English rock band formed in Birmingham in 1968 by guitarist Tony Iommi, drummer Bill Ward, bassist Geezer Butler and vocalist Ozzy Osbourne. They are often cited as pioneers of heavy metal music. The band helped define the genre with releases such as <i>Black Sabbath</i> (1970), <i>Paranoid</i> (1970) and <i>Master of Reality</i> (1971). The band had multiple line-up changes following Osbourne's departure in 1979 and Iommi is the only constant member throughout their history.
</p><p>After previous iterations of the group – the Polka Tulk Blues Band and Earth – the band settled on the name Black Sabbath in 1969. They distinguished themselves through occult themes with horror-inspired lyrics and down-tuned guitars. Signing to Philips Records in November 1969, they released their first single, ""Evil Woman"", in January 1970, and their debut album, <i>Black Sabbath</i>, was released the following month. Though it received a negative critical response, the album was a commercial success, leading to a follow-up record, <i>Paranoid</i>, later that year. The band's popularity grew, and by 1973's <i>Sabbath Bloody Sabbath</i>, critics were starting to respond favourably.
</p><p>Osbourne's excessive substance abuse led to his firing in 1979. He was replaced by former Rainbow vocalist Ronnie James Dio. Following two albums with Dio, <i>Heaven and Hell</i> and <i>Mob Rules</i>, the second of which saw drummer Vinny Appice replace Ward, Black Sabbath endured many personnel changes from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s that included vocalists Ian Gillan, Glenn Hughes, Ray Gillen and Tony Martin, as well as several drummers and bassists, with Butler's departure in 1984 leaving Iommi as the only remaining original member. Martin, who replaced Gillen in 1987, was the second-longest serving vocalist after Osbourne and recorded three albums with Black Sabbath before his dismissal in 1991. That same year, Iommi rejoined with Butler, Dio and Appice to record <i>Dehumanizer</i> (1992). After two more studio albums with Martin, who returned to replace Dio in 1993, the band's original line-up reunited in 1997 and released a live album, <i>Reunion,</i> the following year; they continued to tour occasionally until 2005. Other than various back catalogue reissues and compilation albums, as well as the <i>Mob Rules</i>-era line-up reuniting as Heaven &amp; Hell, there was no further activity under the Black Sabbath name until 2011 with the release of their final studio album and 19th overall, <i>13</i>, in 2013, which features all of the original members except Ward. During their farewell tour, the band played their final concert in their home city of Birmingham on 4 February 2017.
