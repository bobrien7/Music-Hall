<p class=""mw-empty-elt"">

</p>
<p><b>Marshall Bruce Mathers III</b> (born October 17, 1972), known professionally as <b>Eminem</b> (<span></span>; often stylized as <b>EMINƎM</b>), is an American rapper and record producer. He is credited with popularizing hip hop in middle America and is critically acclaimed as one of the greatest rappers of all time. Eminem's global success and acclaimed works are widely regarded as having broken racial barriers for the acceptance of white rappers in popular music. While much of his transgressive work during the late 1990s and early 2000s made him widely controversial, he came to be a representation of popular angst of the American underclass and has been cited as an influence for many artists of various genres.
</p><p>After the release of his debut album <i>Infinite</i> (1996) and the extended play <i>Slim Shady EP</i> (1997), Eminem signed with Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment and subsequently achieved mainstream popularity in 1999 with <i>The Slim Shady LP</i>. His next two releases, <i>The Marshall Mathers LP</i> (2000) and <i>The Eminem Show</i> (2002), were worldwide successes and were both nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. After the release of his next album, <i>Encore</i> (2004), Eminem went on hiatus in 2005, largely due to a prescription drug addiction. He returned to the music industry four years later with the release of <i>Relapse</i> (2009) and <i>Recovery</i> was released the following year. <i>Recovery</i> was the best-selling album worldwide of 2010, making it Eminem's second album, after <i>The Eminem Show</i> in 2002, to be the best-selling album of the year worldwide. In the following years, he released the US number one albums <i>The Marshall Mathers LP 2</i> (2013), <i>Revival</i> (2017), <i>Kamikaze</i> (2018) and <i>Music to Be Murdered By</i> (2020).
</p><p>Eminem made his debut in the film industry with the musical drama film <i>8 Mile</i> (2002), playing a fictionalized version of himself, and his track ""Lose Yourself"" from its soundtrack won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, making him the first hip hop artist ever to win the award. Eminem has made cameo appearances in the films <i>The Wash</i> (2001), <i>Funny People</i> (2009) and <i>The Interview</i> (2014) and the television series <i>Entourage</i> (2010). He has also developed other ventures, including Shady Records, a joint venture with manager Paul Rosenberg, which helped launch the careers of artists such as 50 Cent, D12 and Obie Trice, among others. He has also established his own channel, Shade 45, on Sirius XM Radio.
</p><p>In addition to his solo career, Eminem was a member of the hip hop group D12. He is also known for collaborations with fellow Detroit-based rapper Royce da 5'9""; the two are collectively known as Bad Meets Evil.
</p><p>Eminem is among the best-selling music artists of all time, with estimated worldwide sales of over 220 million records. He was the best-selling music artist in the United States of the 2000s and the best-selling male music artist in the United States of the 2010s, third overall. <i>Billboard</i> named him the ""Artist of the Decade (2000–2009)"". He has had ten number-one albums on the <i>Billboard</i> 200—which all consecutively debuted at number one on the chart, making him the first artist to achieve this—and five number-one singles on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. <i>The Marshall Mathers LP</i>, <i>The Eminem Show</i>, <i>Curtain Call: The Hits</i> (2005), ""Lose Yourself"", ""Love the Way You Lie"" and ""Not Afraid"" have all been certified Diamond or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). <i>Rolling Stone</i> has included him in its lists of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time and the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time. He has won numerous awards, including 15 Grammy Awards, eight American Music Awards, 17 <i>Billboard</i> Music Awards, an Academy Award, a Primetime Emmy Award and an MTV Europe Music Global Icon Award. In November 2022, Eminem was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.</p>

Intent on pursuing a solo career as a rapper, he released his debut studio album, <i>The College Dropout</i> (2004), to critical and commercial success. He founded the record label GOOD Music later that year. West explored diverse musical elements like orchestras, synthesizers, and autotune on the albums <i>Late Registration</i> (2005), <i>Graduation</i> (2007), and <i>808s &amp; Heartbreak</i> (2008). His fifth and sixth albums <i>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</i> (2010) and <i>Yeezus</i> (2013) were also met with critical and commercial success.

His tenth album <i>Donda</i> (2021) was released to continued commercial success but mixed critical reception. West's discography also includes the two full-length collaborative albums <i>Watch the Throne</i> (2011) with Jay-Z and <i>Kids See Ghosts</i> (2018) with Kid Cudi.

As a fashion designer, he has collaborated with Nike, Louis Vuitton, Gap, and A.P.C. on clothing and footwear and led the Yeezy collaboration with Adidas. He is also the founder and head of the creative content company Donda.
</p><p>West's outspoken views have received significant media coverage; he has been a frequent source of controversy due to his conduct on social media and at awards shows and public settings, as well as his comments on the music and fashion industries, U.S. politics, race, and slavery. His Christian faith, high-profile marriage to Kim Kardashian, and mental health have also been topics of media attention. In 2020, West launched an unsuccessful independent presidential campaign that primarily advocated for a consistent life ethic. In 2022, he was widely condemned and lost many sponsors and partnerships—including his collaborations with Adidas, Gap, and Balenciaga—after making a series of antisemitic statements. In November 2022, he announced his 2024 presidential campaign, appearing publicly with Nick Fuentes, a white supremacist. He later publicly praised Adolf Hitler, denied the Holocaust, and identified as a Nazi.</p>"

<p class=""mw-empty-elt"">



</p>
<p><b>Michael Joseph Jackson</b> (August 29, 1958 – June 25, 2009) was an American singer, songwriter, dancer, and philanthropist. Dubbed the ""King of Pop"", he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century. Over a four-decade career, his contributions to music, dance, and fashion, along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture. Jackson influenced artists across many music genres; through stage and video performances, he popularized complicated dance moves such as the moonwalk, to which he gave the name, as well as the robot. He is the most awarded recording artist in pop music history.</p><p>The eighth child of the Jackson family, Jackson made his public debut in 1964 with his older brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon as a member of the Jackson 5 (later known as the Jacksons). Jackson began his solo career in 1971 while at Motown Records. He became a solo star with his 1979 album <i>Off the Wall</i>. His music videos, including those for ""Beat It"", ""Billie Jean"", and ""Thriller"" from his 1982 album <i>Thriller</i>, are credited with breaking racial barriers and transforming the medium into an artform and promotional tool. He helped propel the success of MTV and continued to innovate with videos for the albums <i>Bad</i> (1987), <i>Dangerous</i> (1991), <i>HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I</i> (1995), and <i>Invincible</i> (2001). <i>Thriller</i> became the best-selling album of all time, while <i>Bad</i> was the first album to produce five US <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 number-one singles.</p><p>From the late 1980s, Jackson became a figure of controversy and speculation due to his changing appearance, relationships, behavior, and lifestyle. In 1993, he was accused of sexually abusing the child of a family friend. The lawsuit was settled out of civil court; Jackson was not indicted due to lack of evidence. In 2005, he was tried and acquitted of further child sexual abuse allegations and several other charges. The FBI found no evidence of criminal conduct by Jackson in either case. In 2009, while he was preparing for a series of comeback concerts, This Is It, Jackson died from an overdose of propofol administered by his personal physician, Conrad Murray, who was convicted in 2011 of involuntary manslaughter. His death triggered reactions around the world, creating unprecedented surges of Internet traffic and a spike in sales of his music. A televised memorial service for Jackson, held at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, was viewed by an estimated over 2.5 billion people globally.
</p><p>Jackson is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with estimated sales of over 400<span> </span>million records worldwide. He had 13 <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 number-one singles (third highest of any artist in the Hot 100 era) and was the first artist to have a top-ten single in the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 in five different decades. He is regarded by the RIAA as the highest-selling individual music artist of all time worldwide. His honors include 15 Grammy Awards, 6 Brit Awards, a Golden Globe Award, and 39 Guinness World Records, including the ""Most Successful Entertainer of All Time"". Jackson's inductions include the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (twice), the Vocal Group Hall of Fame, the Songwriters Hall of Fame, the Dance Hall of Fame (the only recording artist to be inducted), and the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame.

<p><b>David Robert Jones</b> (8 January 1947 – 10 January 2016), known professionally as <b>David Bowie</b> (<span></span> <i title=""English pronunciation respelling""><span>BOH</span>-ee</i>), was an English singer-songwriter and actor. A leading figure in the music industry, he is regarded as one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century. Bowie was acclaimed by critics and musicians, particularly for his innovative work during the 1970s. His career was marked by reinvention and visual presentation, and his music and stagecraft had a significant impact on popular music.
</p><p>Bowie developed an interest in music from an early age. He studied art, music and design before embarking on a professional career as a musician in 1963. ""Space Oddity"", released in 1969, was his first top-five entry on the UK Singles Chart. After a period of experimentation, he re-emerged in 1972 during the glam rock era with his flamboyant and androgynous alter ego Ziggy Stardust. The character was spearheaded by the success of Bowie's single ""Starman"" and album <i>The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars</i>, which won him widespread popularity. In 1975, Bowie's style shifted towards a sound he characterised as ""plastic soul"", initially alienating many of his UK fans but garnering him his first major US crossover success with the number-one single ""Fame"" and the album <i>Young Americans</i>. In 1976, Bowie starred in the cult film <i>The Man Who Fell to Earth</i> and released <i>Station to Station</i>. In 1977, he again changed direction with the electronic-inflected album <i>Low</i>, the first of three collaborations with Brian Eno that came to be known as the ""Berlin Trilogy"". <i>""Heroes""</i> (1977) and <i>Lodger</i> (1979) followed; each album reached the UK top five and received lasting critical praise.
</p><p>After uneven commercial success in the late 1970s, Bowie had three number-one hits: the 1980 single ""Ashes to Ashes"", its album <i>Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)</i>, and ""Under Pressure"" (a 1981 collaboration with Queen). He achieved massive commercial success in the 1980s with <i>Let's Dance</i> (1983). Between 1988 and 1992, he fronted the hard rock band Tin Machine before resuming his solo career in 1993. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Bowie continued to experiment with musical styles, including industrial and jungle. He also continued acting; his roles included Major Jack Celliers in <i>Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence</i> (1983), Jareth the Goblin King in <i>Labyrinth</i> (1986), Pontius Pilate in <i>The Last Temptation of Christ</i> (1988), and Nikola Tesla in <i>The Prestige</i> (2006), among other film and television appearances and cameos. He stopped touring after 2004 and his last live performance was at a charity event in 2006. In 2013, Bowie returned from a decade-long recording hiatus with <i>The Next Day</i>. He remained musically active until his death from liver cancer at his home in New York City. He died two days after both his 69th birthday and the release of his final album, <i>Blackstar</i> (2016).
</p><p>During his lifetime, his record sales, estimated at over 100 million records worldwide, made him one of the best-selling musicians of all time. In the UK, he was awarded ten platinum, eleven gold and eight silver album certifications, and released 11 number-one albums. In the US, he received five platinum and nine gold certifications. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996. <i>Rolling Stone</i> ranked him among the greatest artists in history. As of 2022, Bowie was the best-selling vinyl artist of the 21st century.

</p>
<p><b>John R. Cash</b> (born <b>J. R. Cash</b>; February 26, 1932 – September 12, 2003) was an American country singer-songwriter. Much of Cash's music contained themes of sorrow, moral tribulation, and redemption, especially in the later stages of his career. He was known for his deep, calm bass-baritone voice, the distinctive sound of his Tennessee Three backing band characterized by train-like chugging guitar rhythms, a rebelliousness coupled with an increasingly somber and humble demeanor, free prison concerts, and a trademark all-black stage wardrobe, which earned him the nickname the ""<b>Man in Black</b>"".</p><p>Born to poor cotton farmers in Kingsland, Arkansas, Cash rose to fame during the mid-1950s in the burgeoning rockabilly scene in Memphis, Tennessee, after four years in the Air Force. He traditionally began his concerts by simply introducing himself, ""Hello, I'm Johnny Cash"", followed by ""Folsom Prison Blues"", one of his signature songs. His other signature songs include ""I Walk the Line"", ""Ring of Fire"", ""Get Rhythm"", and ""Man in Black"". He also recorded humorous numbers like ""One Piece at a Time"" and ""A Boy Named Sue"", a duet with his future wife June called ""Jackson"" (followed by many further duets after their wedding), and railroad songs such as ""Hey, Porter"", ""Orange Blossom Special"", and ""Rock Island Line"". During the last stage of his career, he covered songs by contemporary rock artists; among his most notable covers were ""Hurt"" by Nine Inch Nails, ""Rusty Cage"" by Soundgarden, and ""Personal Jesus"" by Depeche Mode.
</p><p>Cash is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 90 million records worldwide. His genre-spanning music embraced country, rock and roll, rockabilly, blues, folk, and gospel sounds. This crossover appeal earned him the rare honor of being inducted into the Country Music, Rock and Roll, and Gospel Music Halls of Fame. His music career was dramatized in the 2005 biopic <i>Walk the Line</i>, in which Cash was portrayed by American film actor Joaquin Phoenix.

Known for her four-octave vocal range and ability to sustain high notes, she has been referred to as the ""Voice of a Generation"". Her works, which incorporate feminism, sexuality, and domestic violence, have generated both critical praise and controversy, for which she is often cited as an influence by other artists. 
</p><p>After appearing in several television programs as a child, Aguilera rose to prominence in 1999 with the release of her debut album, <i>Christina Aguilera</i>, through RCA Records. The album spawned three <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 number-one singles — ""Genie in a Bottle"", ""What a Girl Wants"" and ""Come On Over Baby (All I Want Is You)"" — and earned her the Grammy Award for Best New Artist. The album's musical direction is credited with influencing the revival of teen pop in the late 1990s and early 2000s, while its Spanish-language follow up, <i>Mi Reflejo</i> (2000), is noted for contributing to the 2000s Latin pop boom. Displeased with the nature of her earlier work, Aguilera assumed artistic control of her fourth studio album, <i>Stripped</i> (2002). The music video for the album's lead single ""Dirrty"" sparked controversy for exploring her sexuality, leading to the departure of her teen idol image. However, further singles ""Beautiful"", ""Fighter"" and ""Can't Hold Us Down"" became top-ten singles in many countries, and she was named the most successful female artist of 2003.
</p><p>Her fifth album, <i>Back to Basics</i> (2006), was met with favorable reviews and became the second of her career to debut atop of the <i>Billboard</i> 200. Its singles ""Ain't No Other Man"", ""Candyman"" and ""Hurt"" reached the top-ten positions in most countries. In 2010, Aguilera starred in <i>Burlesque</i> and contributed to its soundtrack. In subsequent years, she featured on the successful singles ""Feel This Moment"", ""Say Something"", and ""Moves Like Jagger"". The latter reached number one on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 making Aguilera one of the few artists to reach the top spot over three decades. Outside of her music, she was named a spokesperson for the World Food Program (WFP), served as a coach on reality competition show <i>The Voice</i> (2011–2016), and acted in the drama series <i>Nashville</i> (2015).
</p><p>Aguilera is considered a pop culture icon and is generally described as a triple threat entertainer. With estimated sales over 90 million records, she is recognized as one of the world's best-selling music artists. In 2009, she was classified as the twentieth most successful artist of the 2000s by <i>Billboard</i>.

<p class=""mw-empty-elt"">


</p>

<p><b>James Marshall</b> ""<b>Jimi</b>"" <b>Hendrix</b> (born <b>Johnny Allen Hendrix</b>; November 27, 1942 – September 18, 1970) was an American guitarist, singer and songwriter. Although his mainstream career spanned only four years, he is widely regarded as one of the most influential electric guitarists in the history of popular music, and one of the most celebrated musicians of the 20th century. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame describes him as ""arguably the greatest instrumentalist in the history of rock music.""</p><p>Born in Seattle, Washington, Hendrix began playing guitar at the age of 15. In 1961, he enlisted in the US Army, but was discharged the following year. Soon afterward, he moved to Clarksville then Nashville, Tennessee, and began playing gigs on the chitlin' circuit, earning a place in the Isley Brothers' backing band and later with Little Richard, with whom he continued to work through mid-1965. He then played with Curtis Knight and the Squires before moving to England in late 1966 after bassist Chas Chandler of the Animals became his manager. Within months, Hendrix had earned three UK top ten hits with the Jimi Hendrix Experience: ""Hey Joe"", ""Purple Haze"", and ""The Wind Cries Mary"". He achieved fame in the US after his performance at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967, and in 1968 his third and final studio album, <i>Electric Ladyland</i>, reached number one in the US. The double LP was Hendrix's most commercially successful release and his first and only number one album. The world's highest-paid performer, he headlined the Woodstock Festival in 1969 and the Isle of Wight Festival in 1970 before his accidental death in London from barbiturate-related asphyxia on September 18, 1970.
</p><p>Hendrix was inspired by American rock and roll and electric blues. He favored overdriven amplifiers with high volume and gain, and was instrumental in popularizing the previously undesirable sounds caused by guitar amplifier feedback. He was also one of the first guitarists to make extensive use of tone-altering effects units in mainstream rock, such as fuzz distortion, Octavia, wah-wah, and Uni-Vibe. He was the first musician to use stereophonic phasing effects in recordings. Holly George-Warren of <i>Rolling Stone</i> commented: ""Hendrix pioneered the use of the instrument as an electronic sound source. Players before him had experimented with feedback and distortion, but Hendrix turned those effects and others into a controlled, fluid vocabulary every bit as personal as the blues with which he began.""</p><p>Hendrix was the recipient of several music awards during his lifetime and posthumously. In 1967, readers of <i>Melody Maker</i> voted him the Pop Musician of the Year and in 1968, <i>Billboard</i> named him the Artist of the Year and <i>Rolling Stone</i> declared him the Performer of the Year. <i>Disc and Music Echo</i> honored him with the World Top Musician of 1969 and in 1970, <i>Guitar Player</i> named him the Rock Guitarist of the Year. The Jimi Hendrix Experience was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. <i>Rolling Stone</i> ranked the band's three studio albums, <i>Are You Experienced</i>, <i>Axis: Bold as Love</i>, and <i>Electric Ladyland</i>, among the 100 greatest albums of all time, and they ranked Hendrix as the greatest guitarist and the sixth-greatest artist of all time.

</p>
<p><b>Scott Ramon Seguro Mescudi</b> (born January 30, 1984), also known by his stage name <b>Kid Cudi</b> (<span></span> <i title=""English pronunciation respelling""><span>KUDD</span>-ee</i>), is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, record producer, actor and fashion designer. Born and raised in Cleveland, Ohio, Cudi would move to New York City in pursuit of a musical career, where he first gained major recognition following the release of his debut single ""Day 'n' Nite"", which he initially self-published on his MySpace page. The song went on to become a worldwide hit and served as the catalyst for Cudi to team with American record producers Plain Pat and Emile Haynie, to record his first official full-length project, a mixtape titled <i>A Kid Named Cudi</i> (2008). The mixtape helped Cudi rise to prominence and establish a fan base, and it caught the attention of high-profile musician Kanye West, who subsequently signed Cudi to his GOOD Music label imprint by late 2008.
</p><p>Cudi's commercial debut single was later remastered and featured on his seminal debut album, <i>Man on the Moon: The End of Day</i> (2009), which was certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album also included the singles ""Make Her Say"" (featuring Kanye West and Common) and ""Pursuit of Happiness"" (featuring MGMT and Ratatat), the latter of which achieved diamond status (10x platinum) by the RIAA. In 2010, Cudi released his second album, <i>Man on the Moon II: The Legend of Mr. Rager</i>, which also attained platinum status and features the singles ""Erase Me"" (featuring Kanye West) and ""Mr. Rager"". Later that year he formed WZRD, a rock band, with his long-time collaborator Dot da Genius. Their eponymous debut album (2012) debuted at number one on the <i>Billboard</i> Top Rock Albums chart.</p><p>Cudi would go on to release the self-produced solo album <i>Indicud</i> (2013), which was certified gold by the RIAA and spawned the platinum-selling single ""Just What I Am"" (featuring King Chip). He would continue to produce the bulk of his own records, including the avant-garde music albums <i>Satellite Flight: The Journey to Mother Moon</i> (2014) and <i>Speedin' Bullet 2 Heaven</i> (2015), the latter of which was led by the grunge-inspired single ""Confused!"". In 2016, the release of his sixth solo album <i>Passion, Pain &amp; Demon Slayin'</i>, was supported by the lead single ""Surfin'"" (featuring Pharrell Williams). Cudi's joint album with Kanye West, under the eponymous name <i>Kids See Ghosts</i> (2018), was met with widespread critical acclaim. In April 2020, Cudi earned his first number-one song on the US <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 chart with ""The Scotts"", alongside fellow American rapper Travis Scott. His seventh album, <i>Man on the Moon III: The Chosen</i> (2020), was highly acclaimed and a commercial success, having been certified gold by the RIAA. Cudi issued his eighth album <i>Entergalactic</i> (2022), coinciding with the release of a adult animated special of the same name inspired by the album, which was critically praised.
</p><p>After signing to GOOD Music, Cudi has since gone on to launch his own vanity labels, the now-dissolved Dream On and current label imprint Wicked Awesome Records. Cudi also ventured into acting in 2010, when he was cast in the HBO series <i>How to Make It in America</i>. He has since appeared in several feature films, including <i>Goodbye World</i> (2013), <i>Need for Speed</i> (2014), <i>Entourage</i> (2015), <i>Bill &amp; Ted Face the Music</i> (2020), <i>Don't Look Up</i> (2021), and <i>X</i> (2022). In addition, he has made appearances on television shows such as <i>One Tree Hill</i>, <i>The Cleveland Show</i>, <i>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</i>, and <i>Westworld</i>. In 2015, he was the bandleader on the IFC series <i>Comedy Bang! Bang!</i> and in 2020 was added as a cast member for the HBO mini-series <i>We Are Who We Are</i>. In 2020, he launched Mad Solar, a production company for film and television, which produced a documentary titled <i>A Man Named Scott</i> (2021), storying Cudi's music career. Cudi is also founder, creator, and director of the clothing line ""MOTR"", which he launched in 2022.
</p><p>Kid Cudi has been widely recognized as an influence on several contemporary hip hop and alternative acts. His lyrics are often autobiographical and describe his childhood hardships of depression, loneliness and alienation, his struggle with alcohol and drugs into adulthood, and themes of spirituality, heartbreak, dissipation and celebration. The majority of his impact stems from his ability to display vulnerability and address bouts with mental health. He is also noted for his experimental nature, combining elements of psychedelia, R&amp;B, electronica, synthpop, punk and indie rock, in his music. Cudi has sold over 22 million certified records in the United States and has won two Grammy Awards from five nominations. He has worked with numerous prominent artists spanning several different genres in the music industry, namely Jay-Z, Eminem, Kendrick Lamar, David Guetta, Steve Aoki, MGMT, Mary J. Blige, Shakira, Ariana Grande and Michael Bolton, among others.</p>"

For the enduring popularity of her holiday music, particularly the 1994 song ""All I Want for Christmas Is You"", she has also been dubbed the ""Queen of Christmas"". Carey rose to fame in 1990 with her debut album <i>Mariah Carey</i>. She was the first artist to have their first five singles reach number one on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100, from ""Vision of Love"" to ""Emotions"". An inductee into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, she is credited for inspiring several generations of pop and R&amp;B artists, and for merging hip hop with pop music through her crossover collaborations.</p><p>Carey's self-titled debut album was released under the guidance of Columbia Records executive Tommy Mottola, who married her three years later. She gained further worldwide success with the albums <i>Music Box</i> (1993)  and <i>Daydream</i> (1995). Their singles include ""Hero"", ""Without You"", ""Fantasy"", ""Always Be My Baby"", and ""One Sweet Day"", which topped the US <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 decade-end chart (1990s) and was the longest running number one song of the decade. After separating from Mottola, Carey adopted a new urban image and incorporated more elements of hip hop with the album <i>Butterfly</i> (1997). She left Columbia in 2001 after eleven consecutive years of US number-one singles and signed a $100 million record deal with Virgin Records.
</p><p>Following Carey's highly publicized physical and emotional breakdown and the failure of the film <i>Glitter</i> (2001) and its soundtrack, Virgin bought out her contract and she signed with Island Records the following year. After a comparatively unsuccessful period, Carey returned to the top of the charts with <i>The Emancipation of Mimi</i> (2005), which became the best-selling album in the US and the world's second best-selling album of 2005. Its second single, ""We Belong Together"", topped the US <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 decade-end chart (2000s). She won the Breakthrough Actress Performance award at the Palm Springs International Film Festival for her role in the 2009 film <i>Precious</i>. Carey's subsequent ventures included being an <i>American Idol</i> judge, starring in the docu-series <i>Mariah's World</i>, appearing in the films <i>The Butler</i> (2013), <i>A Christmas Melody</i> (2015), and <i>The Lego Batman Movie</i> (2017), performing at two Las Vegas concert residencies, and publishing her memoir <i>The Meaning of Mariah Carey</i> in 2020.
</p><p>Carey is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with over 220 million records sold worldwide.

</p>
<p><b>Kelly Brianne</b>, known professionally as <b>Kelly Clarkson</b>, (born April 24, 1982) is an American singer, songwriter, author, and television personality. She rose to fame after winning the first season of <i>American Idol</i> in 2002, which earned her a record deal with RCA. Her debut single, ""A Moment Like This"", topped the US <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100, and became the country's best selling single of 2002. It was included on her debut studio album, <i>Thankful</i> (2003), which debuted atop the <i>Billboard</i> 200. Trying to reinvent her image, Clarkson parted ways with <i>Idol</i> management and shifted to pop rock for her second studio album, <i>Breakaway</i> (2004). Supported by four US top-ten singles – the title track, ""Since U Been Gone"", ""Behind These Hazel Eyes"", and ""Because of You"" – <i>Breakaway</i> sold over 12 million copies worldwide and won two Grammy Awards.
</p><p>Clarkson took further creative control for her third studio album, <i>My December</i> (2007), co-writing all of its tracks and becoming its executive producer. However, her label was dissatisfied with the album's darker rock music and promoted it reluctantly. Clarkson's fourth and fifth studio albums, <i>All I Ever Wanted</i> (2009) and <i>Stronger</i> (2011), returned to a lighter tone and pop rock sound, with the former becoming her second US number-one album and the latter making her the first artist to win the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album twice. Both albums spawned a Hot 100 number-one single: ""My Life Would Suck Without You"", which holds the record for the biggest jump to number one in the chart's history, and ""Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)"", which became her best-selling single worldwide. Clarkson then had the best-selling Christmas album of the year with <i>Wrapped in Red</i> (2013). Its single, ""Underneath the Tree"", was named the ASCAP's most popular Christmas song released in the 21st century. Her seventh studio album, <i>Piece by Piece</i> (2015), debuted at number-one in the US, while its title track reached the top ten. After leaving RCA and signing with Atlantic in 2016, Clarkson released her soul-influenced eighth album, <i>Meaning of Life</i> (2017), and her second Christmas album, <i>When Christmas Comes Around...</i> (2021).
</p><p>Clarkson has sold over 25 million albums and 45 million singles worldwide. She has 11 top-ten singles in the US, and nine top-ten singles in the UK, Canada, and Australia. She became the first artist in history to top each of <i>Billboard</i>'s pop, adult contemporary, adult pop, country, and dance charts. Clarkson has also served as a coach on <i>The Voice</i> from its fourteenth season to the twenty-first season, and again for the twenty-third season. Since 2019, she has hosted her own talk show, <i>The Kelly Clarkson Show</i>. Among her numerous accolades, Clarkson has received three MTV Video Music Awards, four American Music Awards, two Academy of Country Music Awards, five Daytime Emmy Awards, and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. <i>Billboard</i> has hailed Clarkson as ""one of pop music's greatest singers"", and honored her with the Powerhouse Award, while VH1 ranked her nineteenth on their list of the 100 Greatest Women in Music.

During his career, Harris has also released several highly successful singles, including Billboard Hot 100 number-one hits ""Whatever You Like"" and ""Live Your Life"" (featuring Rihanna); the latter replaced the former atop the chart and made Harris one of the few artists who replaced themselves at number one and simultaneously occupied the top two positions. Harris began to gain major recognition in 2003 following his first high-profile feature on fellow Atlanta-based rapper Bone Crusher's single ""Never Scared"". Harris earned more prominence with the release of <i>Trap Muzik</i> (2003), which included the Top 40 songs ""Rubber Band Man"" and ""Let's Get Away"" (featuring Jazze Pha).

Clapton ranked second in <i>Rolling Stone</i><span>'</span>s list of the ""100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time"" and fourth in Gibson<span>'</span>s ""Top 50 Guitarists of All Time"". He was also named number five in <i>Time</i> magazine's list of ""The 10 Best Electric Guitar Players"" in 2009.</p><p>After playing in a number of different local bands, Clapton joined the Yardbirds in 1963, replacing founding guitarist Top Topham. Dissatisfied with the change of the Yardbirds sound from blues rock to a more radio-friendly pop rock sound, Clapton left in 1965 to play with John Mayall &amp; the Bluesbreakers. On leaving Mayall in 1966, after one album, he formed the power trio Cream with drummer Ginger Baker and bassist Jack Bruce, in which Clapton played sustained blues improvisations and ""arty, blues-based psychedelic pop"". After Cream broke up in November 1968, he formed the blues rock band Blind Faith with Baker, Steve Winwood, and Ric Grech, recording one album and performing on one tour before they broke up. Clapton embarked on a solo career in 1970.
</p><p>Alongside his solo career, he also performed with Delaney &amp; Bonnie and Derek and the Dominos, with whom he recorded ""Layla"", one of his signature songs. He continued to record a number of successful solo albums and songs over the next several decades, including a 1974 cover of Bob Marley's ""I Shot the Sheriff"" (which helped reggae reach a mass market), the country-infused <i>Slowhand</i> album (1977) and the pop rock of 1986's <i>August</i>.  Following the death of his son Conor in 1991, Clapton's grief was expressed in the song ""Tears in Heaven"", which appeared on his <i>Unplugged</i> album, and in 1996 he had another top-40 hit with the R&amp;B crossover ""Change the World"". In 1998, he released the Grammy award-winning ""My Father's Eyes"". Since 1999, he has recorded a number of traditional blues and blues rock albums and hosted the periodic Crossroads Guitar Festival.

</p>
<p><b>Elvis Aaron Presley</b> (January 8, 1935 – August 16, 1977), often referred to mononymously by his first name, was an American singer, actor and Sergeant in the United States Army. Dubbed the ""King of Rock and Roll"", he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, led him to both great success and initial controversy.
</p><p>Presley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, and relocated to Memphis, Tennessee, with his family when he was 13 years old. His music career began there in 1954, recording at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring the sound of African-American music to a wider audience. Presley, on rhythm acoustic guitar, and accompanied by lead guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, was a pioneer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. In 1955, drummer D. J. Fontana joined to complete the lineup of Presley's classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who would manage him for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA Victor single, ""Heartbreak Hotel"", was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States. Within a year, RCA would sell ten million Presley singles. With a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records, Presley became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll; though his performative style and promotion of the then-marginalized sound of African Americans led to him being widely considered a threat to the moral well-being of the White American youth.</p><p>In November 1956, Presley made his film debut in <i>Love Me Tender</i>. Drafted into military service in 1958, Presley relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. He held few concerts, however, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. Some of his most famous films included <i>Jailhouse Rock</i> (1957), <i>Blue Hawaii</i> (1961), and <i>Viva Las Vegas</i> (1964). In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed television comeback special <i>Elvis</i>, which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973, Presley gave the first concert by a solo artist to be broadcast around the world, <i>Aloha from Hawaii</i>. Years of prescription drug abuse and unhealthy eating habits severely compromised his health, and he died suddenly in 1977 at his Graceland estate at the age of 42.
</p><p>Having sold over 500 million records worldwide, Presley is recognized as the best-selling solo music artist of all time by <i>Guinness World Records.</i> He was commercially successful in many genres, including pop, country, rhythm &amp; blues, adult contemporary, and gospel. Presley won three Grammy Awards, received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at age 36, and has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame. He holds several records, including the most RIAA-certified gold and platinum albums, the most albums charted on the <i>Billboard</i> 200, the most number-one albums by a solo artist on the UK Albums Chart, and the most number-one singles by any act on the UK Singles Chart. In 2018, Presley was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

</p>
<p><b>Francis Albert Sinatra</b> (<span></span>; December 12, 1915 – May 14, 1998) was an American singer, actor and producer. Nicknamed the ""Chairman of the Board"" and later called ""Ol' Blue Eyes"", Sinatra was one of the most popular entertainers of the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s. He is among the world's best-selling music artists with an estimated 150 million record sales.</p><p>Born to Italian immigrants in Hoboken, New Jersey, Sinatra was greatly influenced by the intimate, easy-listening vocal style of Bing Crosby and began his musical career in the swing era with bandleaders Harry James and Tommy Dorsey. He found success as a solo artist after signing with Columbia Records in 1943, becoming the idol of the ""bobby soxers"". Sinatra released his debut album, <i>The Voice of Frank Sinatra</i>, in 1946. When his film career stalled in the early 1950s, Sinatra turned to Las Vegas, where he became one of its best-known residency performers and part of the famous Rat Pack. His acting career was revived by the 1953 film <i>From Here to Eternity</i>, which earned Sinatra an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor. Sinatra then signed with Capitol Records and released several critically lauded albums, some of which were later considered as among the first ""concept albums"", including <i>In the Wee Small Hours</i> (1955), <i>Songs for Swingin' Lovers!</i> (1956), <i>Come Fly with Me</i> (1958), <i>Only the Lonely</i> (1958), <i>No One Cares</i> (1959), and <i>Nice 'n' Easy</i> (1960).
</p><p>Sinatra left Capitol in 1960 to start his own record label, Reprise Records and released a string of successful albums. In 1965, he recorded the retrospective album <i>September of My Years</i> and starred in the Emmy-winning television special <i>Frank Sinatra: A Man and His Music</i>. After releasing <i>Sinatra at the Sands</i>, recorded at the Sands Hotel and Casino in Vegas with frequent collaborator Count Basie in early 1966, the following year he recorded one of his most famous collaborations with Tom Jobim, the album <i>Francis Albert Sinatra &amp; Antonio Carlos Jobim</i>. It was followed by 1968's <i>Francis A. &amp; Edward K.</i> with Duke Ellington. Sinatra retired for the first time in 1971, but came out of retirement two years later. He recorded several albums and resumed performing at Caesars Palace, and released ""New York, New York"" in 1980. Using his Las Vegas shows as a home base, he toured within the United States and internationally until shortly before his death in 1998.
</p><p>Sinatra forged a highly successful career as a film actor. After winning an Academy Award for best supporting actor in <i>From Here to Eternity</i>, he starred in <i>The Man with the Golden Arm</i> (1955) and <i>The Manchurian Candidate</i> (1962). Sinatra also appeared in musicals such as <i>On the Town</i> (1949), <i>Guys and Dolls</i> (1955), <i>High Society</i> (1956), and <i>Pal Joey</i> (1957), which won him another Golden Globe. Toward the end of his career, he frequently played detectives, including the title character in <i>Tony Rome</i> (1967). Sinatra received the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award in 1971. On television, <i>The Frank Sinatra Show</i> began on CBS in 1950, and he continued to make appearances on television throughout the 1950s and 1960s.
</p><p>While Sinatra never learned how to read music, he worked very hard from a young age to improve his abilities in all aspects of music. A perfectionist, renowned for his style and presence, Sinatra always insisted on recording live with his band. He led a colorful personal life and was  involved in turbulent relationships, including his second marriage to Ava Gardner. He later married Mia Farrow in 1966 and Barbara Marx in 1976. Sinatra had several violent confrontations, often with journalists he felt had crossed him or work bosses with whom he had disagreements. He was deeply involved with politics starting in the mid-1940s and actively campaigned for presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan. Sinatra was investigated by the FBI for his alleged relationship with the mafia.
</p><p>Sinatra was honored at the Kennedy Center Honors in 1983, was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Ronald Reagan in 1985, and the Congressional Gold Medal in 1997. He received eleven Grammy Awards, including the Grammy Trustees Award, Grammy Legend Award and the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. Sinatra was included in <i>Time</i> magazine's compilation of the 20th century's 100 most influential people. American music critic Robert Christgau called him ""the greatest singer of the 20th century""  and he continues to be regarded as an iconic figure.</p>"

<p class=""mw-empty-elt"">


</p>
<p><b>Andre Romell Young</b> (born February 18, 1965), known professionally as <b>Dr. Dre</b>, is an American rapper and record producer. He is the founder and CEO of Aftermath Entertainment and Beats Electronics, and previously co-founded, co-owned, and was the president of Death Row Records. Dr. Dre began his career as a member of the World Class Wreckin' Cru in 1985 and later found fame with the gangsta rap group N.W.A. The group popularized explicit lyrics in hip hop to detail the violence of street life. During the early 1990s, Dre was credited as a key figure in the crafting and popularization of West Coast G-funk, a subgenre of hip hop characterized by a synthesizer foundation and slow, heavy beats.
</p><p>Dre's solo debut studio album <i>The Chronic</i> (1992), released under Death Row Records, made him one of the best-selling American music artists of 1993. It earned him a Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance for the single ""Let Me Ride"", as well as several accolades for the single ""Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang"". That year, he produced Death Row labelmate Snoop Doggy Dogg's debut album <i>Doggystyle</i> and mentored producers such as his stepbrother Warren G (leading to the multi-platinum debut <i>Regulate...G Funk Era</i> in 1994) and Snoop Dogg's cousin Daz Dillinger (leading to the double-platinum debut <i>Dogg Food</i> by Tha Dogg Pound in 1995), as well as mentor to upcoming producers Sam Sneed and Mel-Man. In 1996, Dr. Dre left Death Row Records to establish his own label, Aftermath Entertainment. He produced a compilation album, <i>Dr. Dre Presents the Aftermath</i>, in 1996, and released a solo album, <i>2001</i>, in 1999.
</p><p>During the 2000s, Dre focused on producing other artists, occasionally contributing vocals. He signed Eminem in 1998 and 50 Cent in 2002, and co-produced their albums. He has produced albums for and overseen the careers of many other rappers, including the D.O.C., Snoop Dogg, Xzibit, Knoc-turn'al, the Game, Kendrick Lamar, and Anderson .Paak. Dre has also had acting roles in movies such as <i>Set It Off</i>, <i>The Wash</i>, and <i>Training Day</i>. He has won seven Grammy Awards, including Producer of the Year, Non-Classical. <i>Rolling Stone</i> ranked him number 56 on the list of 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. He was the second-richest figure in hip hop as of 2018 with an estimated net worth of $800 million.
</p><p>Accusations of Dre's violence against women have been widely publicized. Following his assault of television host Dee Barnes, he was fined $2,500, given two years' probation, ordered to perform 240 hours of community service, and given a spot on an anti-violence public service announcement. A civil suit was settled out of court. In 2015, Michel'le, the mother of one of his children, accused him of domestic violence during their time together as a couple. Their abusive relationship is portrayed in her 2016 biopic <i>Surviving Compton: Dre, Suge &amp; Michel'le</i>. Lisa Johnson, the mother of three of Dr. Dre's children, stated that he beat her many times, including while she was pregnant. She was granted a restraining order against him. Former labelmate Tairrie B claimed that Dre assaulted her at a party in 1990, in response to her track ""Ruthless Bitch"". Two weeks following the release of his third album, <i>Compton</i> in August 2015, he issued an apology to the women ""I've hurt"".</p>"

</p>
<p><b>Brian Hugh Warner</b> (born January 5, 1969), known professionally as <b>Marilyn Manson</b>, is an American rock musician. He came to prominence as the lead singer of the band that shares his name, of which he remains the only constant member since its formation in 1989. Known for his controversial stage personality and public image, his stage name (like the other founding members of the band) was formed by combining the names of two opposing American cultural icons: actress Marilyn Monroe and cult leader Charles Manson.
</p><p>Manson is best known for music released in the 1990s, including the albums <i>Portrait of an American Family</i> (1994), <i>Antichrist Superstar</i> (1996) and <i>Mechanical Animals</i> (1998), which earned him a reputation in mainstream media as a controversial figure and negative influence on young people when combined with his public image. In the U.S. alone, three of the band's albums have been awarded platinum status and three more went gold, and the band has had eight releases debut in the top 10, including two No. 1 albums. Manson has been ranked at No. 44 on the list of the ""Top 100 Heavy Metal Vocalists"" by <i>Hit Parader</i> and, along with his band, has been nominated for four Grammy Awards–Manson himself earned an additional Grammy nomination for his work on Kanye West's <i>Donda</i>. Manson made his film debut as an actor in David Lynch's <i>Lost Highway</i> (1997), and has since appeared in a variety of minor roles and cameos. In 2002, his first art show, <i>The Golden Age of Grotesque</i>, was held at the Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions center.
</p><p>He is widely considered one of the most controversial figures in heavy metal music, and has been involved in numerous controversies throughout his career. His lyrics were criticized by American politicians and were examined in congressional hearings. Several U.S. states enacted legislation specifically banning the group from performing in state-operated venues. In 1999, news media falsely blamed Manson for influencing the perpetrators of the Columbine High School massacre. His work has been cited in several other violent events; his paintings and films appeared as evidence in a murder trial, and he has been accused of inspiring several other murders and school shootings. In 2021, multiple women accused Manson of psychologically and sexually abusing them, allegations he denied.</p>"

<p><b>Taylor Alison Swift</b> (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Her discography spans multiple genres, and her songwriting—often inspired by her personal life—has received critical praise and wide media coverage. Born in West Reading, Pennsylvania, Swift moved to Nashville at age 14 to become a country artist. She signed a songwriting deal with Sony/ATV Music Publishing in 2004 and a recording contract with Big Machine Records in 2005.

Media scrutiny inspired the urban-flavored <i>Reputation</i> (2017) and its number-one single ""Look What You Made Me Do"".

</p>
<p><b>John Winston Ono Lennon</b> (born <b>John Winston Lennon</b>; 9 October 1940 – 8 December 1980) was an English singer, songwriter, musician and peace activist who achieved worldwide fame as  founder, co-songwriter, co-lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist of the Beatles. Lennon's work was characterised by the rebellious nature and acerbic wit of his music, writing and drawings, on film, and in interviews. His songwriting partnership with Paul McCartney remains the most successful in history.</p><p>Born in Liverpool, Lennon became involved in the skiffle craze as a teenager. In 1956, he formed The Quarrymen, which evolved into the Beatles in 1960. Sometimes called ""the smart Beatle"", he was initially the group's <i>de facto</i> leader, a role gradually ceded to McCartney. Through his songwriting in the Beatles, Lennon embraced a myriad of musical influences, initially writing and co-writing rock and pop-oriented hit songs in the band’s early years, then later incorporating experimental elements into his compositions in the latter half of the Beatles’ career as his songs became known for their increasing innovation. Lennon soon expanded his work into other media by participating in numerous films, including <i>How I Won the War</i>, and authoring <i>In His Own Write</i> and <i>A Spaniard in the Works</i>, both collections of nonsense writings and line drawings. Starting with ""All You Need Is Love"", his songs were adopted as anthems by the anti-war movement and the larger counterculture of the 1960s. In 1969, he started the Plastic Ono Band with his second wife, the multimedia artist Yoko Ono, held the two-week-long anti-war demonstration Bed-ins for Peace, and left the Beatles to embark on a solo career.
</p><p>Between 1968 and 1972, Lennon and Ono collaborated on many works, including a trilogy of avant-garde albums, several more films, his solo debut <i>John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band</i>, and the international top-10 singles  ""Give Peace a Chance"", ""Instant Karma!"", ""Imagine"" and ""Happy Xmas (War Is Over)"". Moving to New York City in 1971, his criticism of the Vietnam War resulted in a three-year deportation attempt by the Nixon administration. Lennon and Ono separated from 1973 to 1975, during which time he produced Harry Nilsson's album <i>Pussy Cats</i>. He also had chart-topping collaborations with Elton John (""Whatever Gets You thru the Night"") and David Bowie (""Fame""). Following a five-year hiatus, Lennon returned to music in 1980 with the Ono collaboration <i>Double Fantasy</i>. He was murdered by a Beatles fan, Mark David Chapman, three weeks after the album's release.
</p><p>As a performer, writer or co-writer, Lennon had 25 number-one singles in the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 chart. <i>Double Fantasy</i>, his best-selling album, won the 1981 Grammy Award for Album of the Year. In 1982, Lennon won the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. In 2002, Lennon was voted eighth in a BBC history poll of the 100 Greatest Britons. <i>Rolling Stone</i> ranked him the fifth-greatest singer and 38th greatest artist of all time. He was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame (in 1997) and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (twice, as a member of the Beatles in 1988 and as a solo artist in 1994).

</p>
<p><b>Stevland Hardaway Morris</b> (<span title=""Name at birth"">né </span> <b>Judkins</b>; May 13, 1950), known professionally as <b>Stevie Wonder</b>, is an American singer-songwriter, who is credited as a pioneer and influence by musicians across a range of genres that include rhythm and blues, pop, soul, gospel, funk, and jazz. A virtual one-man band, Wonder's use of synthesizers and other electronic musical instruments during the 1970s reshaped the conventions of R&amp;B. He also helped drive such genres into the album era, crafting his LPs as cohesive and consistent, in addition to socially conscious statements with complex compositions. Blind since shortly after his birth, Wonder was a child prodigy who signed with Motown's Tamla label at the age of 11, where he was given the professional name <b>Little Stevie Wonder</b>.
</p><p>Wonder's single ""Fingertips"" was a No. 1 hit on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 in 1963, at the age of 13, making him the youngest artist ever to top the chart. Wonder's critical success was at its peak in the 1970s. His ""classic period"" began in 1972 with the releases of <i>Music of My Mind</i> and <i>Talking Book</i>, the latter featuring ""Superstition"", which is one of the most distinctive and famous examples of the sound of the Hohner Clavinet keyboard. His works <i>Innervisions</i> (1973), <i>Fulfillingness' First Finale</i> (1974) and <i>Songs in the Key of Life</i> (1976) all won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year, making him the tied-record holder for the most Album of the Year wins, with three. He is also the only artist to have won the award with three consecutive album releases. Wonder began his ""commercial period"" in the 1980s; he achieved his biggest hits and highest level of fame, had increased album sales, charity participation, high-profile collaborations (including Paul McCartney and Michael Jackson), political impact, and television appearances. Wonder has continued to remain active in music and political causes.
</p><p>Wonder is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with sales of over 100 million records worldwide. He has won 25 Grammy Awards (the most by a solo artist) and one Academy Award (Best Original Song, for the 1984 film <i>The Woman in Red</i>). Wonder has been inducted into the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Songwriters Hall of Fame. He is also noted for his work as an activist for political causes, including his 1980 campaign to make Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday a federal holiday in the U.S. In 2009, he was named a United Nations Messenger of Peace, and in 2014, he was honored with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

<p><b>Christopher George Latore Wallace</b> (May 21, 1972 – March 9, 1997), better known by his stage names <b>the Notorious B.I.G.</b>, <b>Biggie Smalls</b>, or simply <b>Biggie</b>, was an American rapper. Rooted in East Coast hip hop and particularly gangsta rap, he is cited in various media lists as being one of the greatest rappers of all time. Wallace became known for his distinctive laid-back lyrical delivery, offsetting the lyrics' often grim content. His music was often semi-autobiographical, telling of hardship and criminality, but also of debauchery and celebration.</p><p>Born and raised in Brooklyn, New York City, Wallace signed to Sean ""Puffy"" Combs' label Bad Boy Records as it launched in 1993, and gained exposure through features on several other artists' singles that year. His debut album <i>Ready to Die</i> (1994) was met with widespread critical acclaim, and included his signature songs ""Juicy"" and ""Big Poppa"". The album made him the central figure in East Coast hip hop, and restored New York's visibility at a time when the West Coast hip hop scene was dominating hip hop music. Wallace was awarded the 1995 <i>Billboard</i> Music Awards' Rapper of the Year. The following year, he led his protégé group Junior M.A.F.I.A., a team of himself and longtime friends, including Lil' Kim, to chart success.
</p><p>During 1996, while recording his second album, Wallace became ensnarled in the escalating East Coast–West Coast hip hop feud. Following Tupac Shakur's death in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas in September 1996, speculations of involvement in Shakur's murder by criminal elements orbiting the Bad Boy circle circulated as a result of Wallace's public feud with Shakur. On March 9, 1997, six months after Shakur's death, Wallace was murdered by an unidentified assailant in a drive-by shooting while visiting Los Angeles. Wallace's second album <i>Life After Death</i>, a double album, was released two weeks later. It reached number one on the <i>Billboard</i> 200, and eventually achieved a diamond certification in the United States.</p><p>With two more posthumous albums released, Wallace has certified sales of over 28 million copies in the United States, including 21 million albums. <i>Rolling Stone</i> has called him the ""greatest rapper that ever lived"", and <i>Billboard</i> named him the greatest rapper of all time. <i>The Source</i> magazine named him the greatest rapper of all time in its 150th issue. In 2006, MTV ranked him at No. 3 on their list of <i>The Greatest MCs of All Time</i>, calling him possibly ""the most skillful ever on the mic"". In 2020, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

</p>
<p><b>Robert Nesta Marley</b>  (6 February 1945 – 11 May 1981) was a Jamaican singer,  musician, and songwriter. Considered one of the pioneers of reggae, his musical career was marked by fusing elements of reggae, ska, and rocksteady, as well as his distinctive vocal and songwriting style. Marley's contributions to music increased the visibility of Jamaican music worldwide, and made him a global figure in popular culture to this day. Over the course of his career, Marley became known as a Rastafari icon, and he infused his music with a sense of spirituality. He is also considered a global symbol of Jamaican music and culture and identity, and was controversial in his outspoken support for democratic social reforms. In 1976, Marley survived an assassination attempt in his home, which was thought to be politically motivated. He also supported legalisation of marijuana, and advocated for Pan-Africanism.</p><p>Born in Nine Mile, Jamaica, Marley began his professional musical career in 1963, after forming the Teenagers with Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer, which after several name changes would become the Wailers. The group released its debut studio album <i>The Wailing Wailers</i> in 1965, which contained the single ""One Love"", a reworking of ""People Get Ready""; the song was popular worldwide, and established the group as a rising figure in reggae. The Wailers released a further eleven studio albums, and after signing to Island Records the band's name became Bob Marley and the Wailers. While initially employing louder instrumentation and singing, the group began engaging in rhythmic-based song construction in the late 1960s and early 1970s, which coincided with Marley's conversion to Rastafari. Around this time, Marley relocated to London, and the group embodied their musical shift with the release of the album <i>The Best of The Wailers</i> (1971).</p><p>The group started to gain international attention after signing to Island, and touring in support of the albums <i>Catch a Fire</i> and <i>Burnin'</i> (both 1973). Following the disbandment of the Wailers a year later, Marley carried on under the band's name. The album <i>Natty Dread</i> (1974) received positive reception. In 1975, following the global popularity of Eric Clapton's version of Marley's ""I Shot the Sheriff"",  Marley had his international breakthrough with his first hit outside Jamaica, with a live version of ""No Woman, No Cry"", from the <i>Live!</i> album. This was followed by his breakthrough album in the United States, <i>Rastaman Vibration</i> (1976), which reached the Top 50 of the Billboard Soul Charts. A few months after the album's release Marley survived an assassination attempt at his home in Jamaica, which prompted him to permanently relocate to London. During his time in London he recorded the album <i>Exodus</i> (1977); it incorporated elements of blues, soul, and British rock and enjoyed widespread commercial and critical success. In 1977, Marley was diagnosed with acral lentiginous melanoma; he died as a result of the illness in 1981, shortly after baptism into the Ethiopian Orthodox Church.  His fans around the world expressed their grief, and he received a state funeral in Jamaica.
</p><p>The greatest hits album <i>Legend</i> was released in 1984, and became the best-selling reggae album of all time. Marley also ranks as one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with estimated sales of more than 75 million records worldwide. He was posthumously honoured by Jamaica soon after his death with a designated Order of Merit by his nation. In 1994, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. <i>Rolling Stone</i> ranked him No. 11 on its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. His other achievements include a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and induction into the Black Music &amp; Entertainment Walk of Fame.

<p><b>William Martin Joel</b> (born May 9, 1949) is an American singer, pianist and songwriter. Commonly nicknamed the ""Piano Man"" after his signature song of the same name, he has led a commercially successful career as a solo artist since the 1970s, having released 12 pop and rock studio albums from 1971 to 1993 as well as one studio album of classical compositions in 2001. He is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, as well as the seventh-best-selling recording artist and the fourth-best-selling solo artist in the United States, with over 160 million records sold worldwide. His 1985 compilation album, <i>Greatest Hits Vol. 1 &amp; 2</i>, is one of the best-selling albums in the United States.</p><p>Born in The Bronx, Joel grew up on Long Island, where both places influenced his music. Growing up, he took piano lessons at his mother's insistence. After dropping out of high school to pursue a music career, Joel took part in two short-lived bands, The Hassles and Attila, before signing a record deal with Family Productions and starting off a solo career in 1971 with his first release <i>Cold Spring Harbor</i>. In 1972, Joel caught the attention of Columbia Records after a live radio performance of the song ""Captain Jack"" became popular in Philadelphia, prompting him to sign a new record deal with the company and release his second album, <i>Piano Man</i>, in 1973. After <i>Streetlife Serenade</i> and <i>Turnstiles</i> in 1974 and 1976 respectively, Joel released his critical and commercial breakthrough album, <i>The Stranger</i>, in 1977. This album became Columbia's bestselling release, selling over 10 million copies and spawning several hit singles, including ""Just the Way You Are"", ""Movin' Out (Anthony's Song)"", ""Only the Good Die Young"", and ""She's Always a Woman""; the album also contains the popular album tracks ""Scenes from an Italian Restaurant"", Joel's favorite of his own songs which has become a firm staple of his live shows, and ""Vienna"", also one of Joel's personal favorites and nowadays one of his most streamed songs on the internet.</p><p>Joel's next album, <i>52nd Street</i>, was released in 1978 and it soon became his first album to peak at No.1 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 chart.

His next album, <i>The Nylon Curtain</i>, was released in 1982, and stemmed from a desire to create more lyrically and melodically ambitious music. <i>An Innocent Man</i>, released in 1983, served as a homage to genres of music which Joel had grown up with in the 1950s, such as rhythm and blues and doo-wop; this release featured ""Tell Her About It"", ""Uptown Girl"" and ""The Longest Time"", three of his best-known songs.

Louis Armstrong,,1901|8|4,New Orleans,1919–1971,,Louis Armstrong,"<p class=""mw-empty-elt"">

</p>
<p><b>Louis Daniel Armstrong</b> (August 4, 1901 – July 6, 1971), nicknamed ""<b>Satchmo</b>"", ""<b>Satch</b>"", and ""<b>Pops</b>"", was an American trumpeter and vocalist. He was among the most influential figures in jazz. His career spanned five decades and several eras in the history of jazz. He received numerous accolades including the Grammy Award for Best Male Vocal Performance for <i>Hello, Dolly!</i> in 1965, as well as a posthumous win for the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1972, and the induction into the National Rhythm &amp; Blues Hall of Fame in 2017.</p><p>Armstrong was born and raised in New Orleans. Coming to prominence in the 1920s as an inventive trumpet and cornet player, Armstrong was a foundational influence in jazz, shifting the focus of the music from collective improvisation to solo performance. Around 1922, he followed his mentor, Joe ""King"" Oliver, to Chicago to play in the Creole Jazz Band. He earned a reputation at ""cutting contests"", and his fame reached band leader Fletcher Henderson. He moved to New York City, where he became a featured and musically influential band soloist and recording artist. By the 1950s, he was a national musical icon, assisted in part, by his appearances on radio and in film and television, in addition to his concerts.
</p><p>His best known songs include ""What a Wonderful World"", ""La Vie en Rose"", ""Hello, Dolly!"", ""On the Sunny Side of the Street"", ""Dream a Little Dream of Me"", ""When You're Smiling"" and ""When the Saints Go Marching In"". He collaborated with Ella Fitzgerald producing three records together <i>Ella and Louis</i> (1956), <i>Ella and Louis Again</i> (1957), and <i>Porgy and Bess</i> (1959). He also appeared in films such as <i>A Rhapsody in Black and Blue</i> (1932), <i>Cabin in the Sky</i> (1943), <i>High Society</i> (1956), <i>Paris Blues</i> (1961), <i>A Man Called Adam</i> (1966), and <i>Hello, Dolly!</i> (1969).
</p><p>With his instantly recognizable rich, gravelly voice, Armstrong was also an influential singer and skillful improviser, bending the lyrics and melody of a song. He was also skilled at scat singing. By the end of Armstrong's life, his influence had spread to popular music in general. Armstrong was one of the first popular African-American entertainers to ""cross over"" to wide popularity with white (and international) audiences. He rarely publicly politicized his race, to the dismay of fellow African Americans, but took a well-publicized stand for desegregation in the Little Rock crisis. He was able to access the upper echelons of American society at a time when this was difficult for black men.

<p><b>Steven Paul Smith</b> (August 6, 1969 – October 21, 2003), known professionally as <b>Elliott Smith</b>, was an American singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist. Smith was born in Omaha, Nebraska, raised primarily in Texas, and lived much of his life in Portland, Oregon, where he gained popularity. Smith's primary instrument was the guitar, though he also played piano, clarinet, bass guitar, drums, and harmonica. He had a distinctive vocal style, characterized by his ""whispery, spiderweb-thin delivery"", and often used multi-tracking to create vocal layers, textures, and harmonies.
</p><p>After playing in the rock band Heatmiser for several years, Smith began his solo career in 1994, with releases on the independent record labels Cavity Search and Kill Rock Stars (KRS). In 1997, he signed a contract with DreamWorks Records, for which he recorded his final two albums. Smith rose to mainstream prominence when his song ""Miss Misery""—included in the soundtrack for the film <i>Good Will Hunting </i>(1997)—was nominated for the 1998 Academy Award for Best Original Song.</p><p>Smith was a heavy drinker and drug user, and was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and depression. His struggles with drugs and mental illness affected his life and work, and often appeared in his lyrics. In 2003, aged 34, he died in Los Angeles, California, from two stab wounds to the chest. The autopsy evidence did not determine whether the wounds were self-inflicted. At the time of his death, Smith was working on his sixth studio album, <i>From a Basement on the Hill</i>, which was posthumously produced and released in 2004.

</p>
<p><b>Sir James Paul McCartney</b>  (born 18 June 1942) is an English singer, songwriter and musician who gained worldwide fame with the Beatles, for whom he played bass guitar and shared primary songwriting and lead vocal duties with John Lennon. One of the most successful composers and performers of all time, McCartney is known for his melodic approach to bass-playing, versatile and wide tenor vocal range, and musical eclecticism, exploring genres ranging from pre–rock and roll pop to classical, ballads, and electronica. His songwriting partnership with Lennon remains the most successful in history.</p><p>Born in Liverpool, McCartney taught himself piano, guitar and songwriting as a teenager, having been influenced by his father, a jazz player, and rock and roll performers such as Little Richard and Buddy Holly. He began his career when he joined Lennon's skiffle group, the Quarrymen, in 1957, which evolved into the Beatles in 1960. Sometimes called ""the cute Beatle"", McCartney later involved himself with the London avant-garde and spearheaded the incorporation of experimental aesthetics into the Beatles' studio productions. Starting with the 1967 album <i>Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</i>, he gradually became the band's <i>de facto</i> leader, providing the creative impetus for most of their music and film projects. Many of his Beatles songs, including ""And I Love Her"", ""Yesterday"", ""Eleanor Rigby"", and ""Blackbird"", rank among the most covered songs in history. While primarily a bassist with the Beatles, in various songs he played a number of other instruments, including keyboards, guitars, and drums.
</p><p>After the Beatles disbanded, he debuted as a solo artist with the 1970 album <i>McCartney</i> and formed the band Wings with his first wife, Linda, and Denny Laine. Led by McCartney, Wings was one of the most successful bands of the 1970s, and he wrote or co-wrote their US or UK number-one hits ""My Love"", ""Band on the Run"", ""Listen to What the Man Said"", ""Silly Love Songs"", and ""Mull of Kintyre"". He resumed his solo career in 1980 and has toured as a solo artist since 1989. Without Wings, his UK or US number-one hits have included ""Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey"" (with Linda), ""Coming Up"", ""Pipes of Peace"", ""Ebony and Ivory"" (with Stevie Wonder), and ""Say Say Say"" (with Michael Jackson). Beyond music, he has taken part in projects to promote international charities related to such subjects as animal rights, seal hunting, land mines, vegetarianism, poverty, and music education.
</p><p>McCartney has written or co-written a record 32 songs that have topped the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 and, as of 2009, had sales of 25.5 million RIAA-certified units in the US. His honours include two inductions into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (as a member of the Beatles in 1988 and as a solo artist in 1999), an Academy Award, a Primetime Emmy Award, 18 Grammy Awards, an appointment as a Member of the Order of the British Empire in 1965 and a knighthood in 1997 for services to music. As of 2020, he is one of the wealthiest musicians in the world, with an estimated fortune of £800 million.</p>

</p>

<p><b>Sir George Ivan Morrison</b>  (born 31 August 1945), known professionally as <b>Van Morrison</b>, is a Northern Irish singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist whose recording career spans seven decades. He has won two Grammy Awards.</p><p>As a teenager in the late 1950s, he played a variety of instruments such as guitar, harmonica, keyboards and saxophone for several Irish showbands, covering the popular hits of that time. Known as ""Van the Man"" to his fans, Morrison rose to prominence in the mid 1960s as the lead singer of the Northern Irish R&amp;B and rock band Them. With Them, he recorded the garage band classic ""Gloria"".
</p><p>Under the pop-oriented guidance of Bert Berns, Morrison's solo career began in 1967 with the release of the hit single ""Brown Eyed Girl"". After Berns's death, Warner Bros. Records bought out Morrison's contract and allowed him three sessions to record <i>Astral Weeks</i> (1968). While initially a poor seller, the album has become regarded as a classic. <i>Moondance</i> (1970) established Morrison as a major artist, and he built on his reputation throughout the 1970s with a series of acclaimed albums and live performances.
</p><p>Much of Morrison's music is structured around the conventions of soul music and early rhythm and blues. An equal part of his catalogue consists of lengthy, spiritually inspired musical journeys that show the influence of Celtic tradition, jazz and stream-of-consciousness narrative, such as the album <i>Astral Weeks</i>. The two strains together are sometimes referred to as ""Celtic soul"". His live performances have been described as ""transcendental"" and ""inspired"", and his music as attaining ""a kind of violent transcendence"".</p><p>Morrison's albums have performed well in Ireland and the UK, with more than 40 reaching the UK top 40. He has scored top ten albums in the UK in four consecutive decades, following the success of 2021's <i>Latest Record Project, Volume 1</i>. Eighteen of his albums have reached the top 40 in the United States, twelve of them between 1997 and 2017. Since turning 70 in 2015, he has released - on average - more than an album a year. He has received two Grammy Awards, the 1994 Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music, the 2017 Americana Music Lifetime Achievement Award for Songwriting and has been inducted into both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In 2016, he was knighted for services to the music industry and to tourism in Northern Ireland.</p>

<p><b>Ella Jane Fitzgerald</b> (April 25, 1917 – June 15, 1996) was an American jazz singer, sometimes referred to as the ""First Lady of Song"", ""Queen of Jazz"", and ""Lady Ella"". She was noted for her purity of tone, impeccable diction, phrasing, timing, intonation, and a ""horn-like"" improvisational ability, particularly in her scat singing.
</p><p>After a tumultuous adolescence, Fitzgerald found stability in musical success with the Chick Webb Orchestra, performing across the country but most often associated with the Savoy Ballroom in Harlem. Her rendition of the nursery rhyme ""A-Tisket, A-Tasket"" helped boost both her and Webb to national fame. After taking over the band when Webb died, Fitzgerald left it behind in 1942 to start her solo career. Her manager was Moe Gale, co-founder of the Savoy, until she turned the rest of her career over to Norman Granz, who founded Verve Records to produce new records by Fitzgerald. With Verve she recorded some of her more widely noted works, particularly her interpretations of the Great American Songbook.
</p><p>While Fitzgerald appeared in films and as a guest on popular television shows in the second half of the twentieth century, her musical collaborations with Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, and The Ink Spots were some of her most notable acts outside of her solo career. These partnerships produced some of her best-known songs such as ""Dream a Little Dream of Me"", ""Cheek to Cheek"", ""Into Each Life Some Rain Must Fall"", and ""It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)"". In 1993, after a career of nearly sixty years, she gave her last public performance. Three years later, she died at age 79 after years of declining health. Her accolades included 14 Grammy Awards, the National Medal of Arts, the NAACP's inaugural President's Award, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

In 2023, <i>Rolling Stone</i> ranked her second on their list of the greatest singers of all time. Houston influenced many singers in popular music, and was known for her powerful, soulful vocals and vocal improvisation skills. She is the only artist to have had seven consecutive number-one singles on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100, from ""Saving All My Love for You"" in 1985 to ""Where Do Broken Hearts Go"" in 1988. Houston also enhanced her popularity upon entering the movie industry. Throughout her career and posthumously, she has received numerous accolades, including two Emmy Awards, six Grammy Awards, 16 <i>Billboard</i> Music Awards, and 28 Guinness World Records. Houston has also been inducted into the Grammy, Rhythm and Blues Music, and Rock and Roll halls of fame.
</p><p>Houston began singing in church as a child and became a background vocalist while in high school.

Although his mainstream career spanned only four years, he is widely regarded as one of the most influential electric guitarists in the history of popular music, and one of the most celebrated musicians of the 20th century. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame describes him as ""arguably the greatest instrumentalist in the history of rock music.""</p><p>Born in Seattle, Washington, Hendrix began playing guitar at the age of 15. In 1961, he enlisted in the US Army, but was discharged the following year. Soon afterward, he moved to Clarksville then Nashville, Tennessee, and began playing gigs on the chitlin' circuit, earning a place in the Isley Brothers' backing band and later with Little Richard, with whom he continued to work through mid-1965. He then played with Curtis Knight and the Squires before moving to England in late 1966 after bassist Chas Chandler of the Animals became his manager. Within months, Hendrix had earned three UK top ten hits with the Jimi Hendrix Experience: ""Hey Joe"", ""Purple Haze"", and ""The Wind Cries Mary"". He achieved fame in the US after his performance at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967, and in 1968 his third and final studio album, <i>Electric Ladyland</i>, reached number one in the US. The double LP was Hendrix's most commercially successful release and his first and only number one album. The world's highest-paid performer, he headlined the Woodstock Festival in 1969 and the Isle of Wight Festival in 1970 before his accidental death in London from barbiturate-related asphyxia on September 18, 1970.
</p><p>Hendrix was inspired by American rock and roll and electric blues. He favored overdriven amplifiers with high volume and gain, and was instrumental in popularizing the previously undesirable sounds caused by guitar amplifier feedback. He was also one of the first guitarists to make extensive use of tone-altering effects units in mainstream rock, such as fuzz distortion, Octavia, wah-wah, and Uni-Vibe. He was the first musician to use stereophonic phasing effects in recordings. Holly George-Warren of <i>Rolling Stone</i> commented: ""Hendrix pioneered the use of the instrument as an electronic sound source. Players before him had experimented with feedback and distortion, but Hendrix turned those effects and others into a controlled, fluid vocabulary every bit as personal as the blues with which he began.""</p><p>Hendrix was the recipient of several music awards during his lifetime and posthumously. In 1967, readers of <i>Melody Maker</i> voted him the Pop Musician of the Year and in 1968, <i>Billboard</i> named him the Artist of the Year and <i>Rolling Stone</i> declared him the Performer of the Year. <i>Disc and Music Echo</i> honored him with the World Top Musician of 1969 and in 1970, <i>Guitar Player</i> named him the Rock Guitarist of the Year. The Jimi Hendrix Experience was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. <i>Rolling Stone</i> ranked the band's three studio albums, <i>Are You Experienced</i>, <i>Axis: Bold as Love</i>, and <i>Electric Ladyland</i>, among the 100 greatest albums of all time, and they ranked Hendrix as the greatest guitarist and the sixth-greatest artist of all time.

</p>
<p><b>James Joseph Brown</b> (May 3, 1933 – December 25, 2006) was an American singer, record producer, bandleader and actor. The central progenitor of funk music and a major figure of the 20th century, he is referred to by various honorific nicknames, some of which include ""the Hardest Working Man in Show Business"", ""Godfather of Soul"", ""Mr. Dynamite"", and ""Soul Brother No. 1"". In a career that lasted more than 50 years, he influenced the development of several music genres. Brown was one of the first 10 inductees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame at its inaugural induction in New York on January 23, 1986. 
</p><p>Brown began his career as a gospel singer in Toccoa, Georgia. He rose to prominence in the mid-1950s as the lead singer of the Famous Flames, a rhythm and blues vocal group founded by Bobby Byrd. With the hit ballads ""Please, Please, Please"" and ""Try Me"", Brown built a reputation as a dynamic live performer with the Famous Flames and his backing band, sometimes known as the James Brown Band or the James Brown Orchestra. His success peaked in the 1960s with the live album <i>Live at the Apollo</i> and hit singles such as ""Papa's Got a Brand New Bag"", ""I Got You (I Feel Good)"" and ""It's a Man's Man's Man's World"".
</p><p>During the late 1960s, Brown moved from a continuum of blues and gospel-based forms and styles to a profoundly ""Africanized"" approach to music-making, emphasizing stripped-down interlocking rhythms that influenced the development of funk music. By the early 1970s, Brown had fully established the funk sound after the formation of the J.B.s with records such as ""Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine"" and ""The Payback"". He also became noted for songs of social commentary, including the 1968 hit ""Say It Loud – I'm Black and I'm Proud"". Brown continued to perform and record until his death from pneumonia in 2006.
</p><p>Brown recorded and released 17 singles that reached No. 1 on the US <i>Billboard</i> R&amp;B charts. He also holds the record for the most singles listed on the US <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 chart that did not reach No. 1. Brown was posthumously inducted into the first class of the Rhythm &amp; Blues Music Hall of Fame in 2013 as an artist and then in 2017 as a songwriter. He also received honors from several other institutions, including inductions into the Black Music &amp; Entertainment Walk of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In Joel Whitburn's analysis of the US <i>Billboard</i> R&amp;B charts from 1942 to 2010, Brown is ranked No. 1 in the Top 500 Artists. He is ranked seventh on <i>Rolling Stone</i><span>'s</span> list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.</p>"

</p>

<p><b>Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart</b> (27 January 1756 – 5 December 1791), baptised as <b>Joannes Chrysostomus Wolfgangus Theophilus Mozart</b>, was a prolific and influential composer of the Classical period. Despite his short life, his rapid pace of composition resulted in more than 800 works of virtually every genre of his time. Many of these compositions are acknowledged as pinnacles of the symphonic, concertante, chamber, operatic, and choral repertoire. Mozart is widely regarded as among the greatest composers in the history of Western music, with his music admired for its ""melodic beauty, its formal elegance and its richness of harmony and texture"".</p><p>Born in Salzburg, then in the Holy Roman Empire, Mozart showed prodigious ability from his earliest childhood. Already competent on keyboard and violin, he composed from the age of five and performed before European royalty. His father took him on a grand tour of Europe and then three trips to Italy. At 17, he was a musician at the Salzburg court but grew restless and travelled in search of a better position.
</p><p>While visiting Vienna in 1781, Mozart was dismissed from his Salzburg position. He stayed in Vienna, where he achieved fame but little financial security. During his final years there, he composed many of his best-known symphonies, concertos, and operas. His Requiem was largely unfinished by the time of his death at the age of 35, the circumstances of which are uncertain and much mythologized.

Johann Sebastian Bach,,31 March 1685,Eisenach,,,Johann Sebastian Bach,"<link rel=""mw-deduplicated-inline-style"" href=""mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096"">
<p class=""mw-empty-elt"">


</p>
<p><b>Johann Sebastian Bach</b> (31 March [O.S. 21 March] 1685 – 28 July 1750) was a German composer and musician of the late Baroque period. He is known for his orchestral music such as the <i>Brandenburg Concertos</i>; instrumental compositions such as the Cello Suites; keyboard works such as the <i>Goldberg Variations</i> and <i>The Well-Tempered Clavier</i>; organ works such as the <i>Schubler Chorales</i> and the Toccata and Fugue in D minor; and vocal music such as the <i>St Matthew Passion</i> and the Mass in B minor. Since the 19th-century Bach revival he has been generally regarded as one of the greatest composers in the history of Western music.</p><p>The Bach family already counted several composers when Johann Sebastian was born as the last child of a city musician in Eisenach. After being orphaned at the age of 10, he lived for five years with his eldest brother Johann Christoph, after which he continued his musical education in Lüneburg. From 1703 he was back in Thuringia, working as a musician for Protestant churches in Arnstadt and Mühlhausen and, for longer stretches of time, at courts in Weimar, where he expanded his organ repertory, and Köthen, where he was mostly engaged with chamber music. From 1723 he was employed as Thomaskantor (cantor at St Thomas's) in Leipzig. There he composed music for the principal Lutheran churches of the city, and for its university's student ensemble Collegium Musicum. From 1726 he published some of his keyboard and organ music. In Leipzig, as had happened during some of his earlier positions, he had difficult relations with his employer, a situation that was little remedied when he was granted the title of court composer by his sovereign, Augustus III of Poland, in 1736. In the last decades of his life he reworked and extended many of his earlier compositions. He died of complications after eye surgery in 1750 at the age of 65.
</p><p>Bach enriched established German styles through his mastery of counterpoint, harmonic, and motivic organisation, and his adaptation of rhythms, forms, and textures from abroad, particularly from Italy and France. Bach's compositions include hundreds of cantatas, both sacred and secular. He composed Latin church music, Passions, oratorios, and motets. He often adopted Lutheran hymns, not only in his larger vocal works, but for instance also in his four-part chorales and his sacred songs. He wrote extensively for organ and for other keyboard instruments. He composed concertos, for instance for violin and for harpsichord, and suites, as chamber music as well as for orchestra. Many of his works employ the genres of canon and fugue.
</p><p>Throughout the 18th century, Bach was primarily valued as an organist, while his keyboard music, such as <i>The Well-Tempered Clavier</i>, was appreciated for its didactic qualities. The 19th century saw the publication of some major Bach biographies, and by the end of that century all of his known music had been printed. Dissemination of scholarship on the composer continued through periodicals (and later also websites) exclusively devoted to him, and other publications such as the <i>Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis</i> (BWV, a numbered catalogue of his works) and new critical editions of his compositions. His music was further popularised through a multitude of arrangements, including the <i>Air on the G String</i> and ""Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring"", and of recordings, such as three different box sets with complete performances of the composer's oeuvre marking the 250th anniversary of his death.

<p class=""mw-empty-elt"">

</p>

<p><b>Lewis Allan Reed</b> (March 2, 1942 – October 27, 2013) was an American musician, songwriter, and poet.  He was the guitarist, singer, and principal songwriter for the rock band the Velvet Underground and had a solo career that spanned five decades. Although not commercially successful during its existence, the Velvet Underground became regarded as one of the most influential bands in the history of underground and alternative rock music. Reed's distinctive deadpan voice, poetic and transgressive lyrics, and experimental guitar playing were trademarks throughout his long career.
</p><p>Having played guitar and sung in doo-wop groups in high school, Reed studied poetry at Syracuse University under Delmore Schwartz, and had served as a radio DJ, hosting a late-night avant garde music program while at college.  After graduating from Syracuse, he went to work for Pickwick Records in New York City, a low-budget record company that specialized in sound-alike recordings, as a songwriter and session musician.  A fellow session player at Pickwick was John Cale; together with Sterling Morrison and Angus MacLise, they would form the Velvet Underground in 1965.  After building a reputation on the avant garde music scene, they gained the attention of Andy Warhol, who became the band's manager; they in turn became something of a fixture at The Factory, Warhol's art studio, and served as his ""house band"" for various projects.  The band released their first album, now with drummer Moe Tucker and featuring German singer Nico, in 1967, and parted ways with Warhol shortly thereafter.  Following several lineup changes and three more little-heard albums, Reed quit the band in 1970.
</p><p>After leaving the band, Reed would go on to a much more commercially successful solo career, releasing twenty solo studio albums. His second, <i>Transformer</i> (1972), was produced by David Bowie and arranged by Mick Ronson, and brought him mainstream recognition. The album is considered an influential landmark of the glam rock genre, anchored by Reed's most successful single, ""Walk on the Wild Side"". After <i>Transformer</i>, the less commercial but critically acclaimed <i>Berlin</i> peaked at No. 7 on the UK Albums Chart. <i>Rock 'n' Roll Animal</i> (a live album released in 1974) sold strongly, and <i>Sally Can't Dance</i> (1974) peaked at No. 10 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200; but for a long period after, Reed's work did not translate into sales, leading him deeper into drug addiction and alcoholism. Reed cleaned up in the early 1980s, and gradually returned to prominence with <i>The Blue Mask</i> (1982) and <i>New Sensations</i> (1984), reaching a critical and commercial career peak with his 1989 album <i>New York</i>.
</p><p>Reed participated in the re-formation of the Velvet Underground in the 1990s, and made several more albums, including a collaboration album with John Cale titled <i>Songs for Drella</i> which was a tribute to their former mentor Andy Warhol. <i>Magic and Loss</i> (1992) would become Reed's highest-charting album on the UK Albums Chart, peaking at No. 6.
</p><p>He contributed music to two theatrical interpretations of 19th century writers, one of which he developed into an album titled <i>The Raven</i>. He married his third wife Laurie Anderson in 2008, and recorded the collaboration album <i>Lulu</i> with Metallica. He died in 2013 of liver disease. Reed has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice; as a member of the Velvet Underground in 1996 and as a solo act in 2015.

Miles Davis,Miles Dewey Davis III,1926|5|26,Alton,,Miles Davis by Palumbo cropped.jpg,Miles Davis,"<p class=""mw-empty-elt"">

</p>
<p><b>Miles Dewey Davis III</b> (May 26, 1926 – September 28, 1991) was an American trumpeter, bandleader, and composer. He is among the most influential and acclaimed figures in the history of jazz and 20th-century music. Davis adopted a variety of musical directions in a five-decade career that kept him at the forefront of many major stylistic developments in jazz.</p><p>Born in Alton, Illinois, and raised in East St. Louis, Davis left to study at Juilliard in New York City, before dropping out and making his professional debut as a member of saxophonist Charlie Parker's bebop quintet from 1944 to 1948. Shortly after, he recorded the <i>Birth of the Cool</i> sessions for Capitol Records, which were instrumental to the development of cool jazz. In the early 1950s, Davis recorded some of the earliest hard bop music while on Prestige Records but did so haphazardly due to a heroin addiction. After a widely acclaimed comeback performance at the Newport Jazz Festival, he signed a long-term contract with Columbia Records and recorded the album <i>'Round About Midnight</i> in 1955. It was his first work with saxophonist John Coltrane and bassist Paul Chambers, key members of the sextet he led into the early 1960s. During this period, he alternated between orchestral jazz collaborations with arranger Gil Evans, such as the Spanish music-influenced <i>Sketches of Spain</i> (1960), and band recordings, such as <i>Milestones</i> (1958) and <i>Kind of Blue</i> (1959). The latter recording remains one of the most popular jazz albums of all time, having sold over five million copies in the U.S.
</p><p>Davis made several line-up changes while recording <i>Someday My Prince Will Come</i> (1961), his 1961 Blackhawk concerts, and <i>Seven Steps to Heaven</i> (1963), another mainstream success that introduced bassist Ron Carter, pianist Herbie Hancock, and drummer Tony Williams. After adding saxophonist Wayne Shorter to his new quintet in 1964, Davis led them on a series of more abstract recordings often composed by the band members, helping pioneer the post-bop genre with albums such as <i>E.S.P</i> (1965) and <i>Miles Smiles</i> (1967), before transitioning into his electric period. During the 1970s, he experimented with rock, funk, African rhythms, emerging electronic music technology, and an ever-changing line-up of musicians, including keyboardist Joe Zawinul, drummer Al Foster, and guitarist John McLaughlin. This period, beginning with Davis's 1969 studio album <i>In a Silent Way</i> and concluding with the 1975 concert recording <i>Agharta</i>, was the most controversial in his career, alienating and challenging many in jazz. His million-selling 1970 record <i>Bitches Brew</i> helped spark a resurgence in the genre's commercial popularity with jazz fusion as the decade progressed.</p><p>After a five-year retirement due to poor health, Davis resumed his career in the 1980s, employing younger musicians and pop sounds on albums such as <i>The Man with the Horn</i> (1981) and <i>Tutu</i> (1986). Critics were often unreceptive but the decade garnered Davis his highest level of commercial recognition. He performed sold-out concerts worldwide, while branching out into visual arts, film, and television work, before his death in 1991 from the combined effects of a stroke, pneumonia and respiratory failure. In 2006, Davis was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, which recognized him as ""one of the key figures in the history of jazz"". <i>Rolling Stone</i> described him as ""the most revered jazz trumpeter of all time, not to mention one of the most important musicians of the 20th century,"" while Gerald Early called him inarguably one of the most influential and innovative musicians of that period.</p>"

</p>

<p><b>James Newell Osterberg Jr.</b> (born April 21, 1947), known professionally as <b>Iggy Pop</b>, is an American singer, musician, radio broadcaster, songwriter and actor. Called the ""Godfather of Punk"", he was the vocalist and lyricist of proto-punk band The Stooges, who were formed in 1967 and have disbanded and reunited many times since.</p><p>Initially playing a raw, primitive style of rock and roll (progressing later towards more experimental and aggressive rock), the Stooges sold few records in their original incarnation and gained a reputation for their confrontational performances, which often involved acts of self-mutilation by Pop. He had a long collaborative relationship and friendship with David Bowie over the course of his career, beginning with the Stooges' album <i>Raw Power</i> in 1973. Both musicians went to West Berlin to wean themselves off their respective drug addictions and Pop began his solo career by collaborating with Bowie on the 1977 albums <i>The Idiot</i> and <i>Lust for Life</i>, Pop usually contributing the lyrics. Throughout his career, he is well known for his outrageous and unpredictable stage antics, poetic lyrics and distinctive voice. He was one of the first performers to do a stage-dive and popularized the activity. Pop, who traditionally (but not exclusively) performs bare-chested, also performed such stage theatrics as rolling around in broken glass and exposing himself to the crowd.</p><p>Pop's music has encompassed a number of styles over the course of his career, including garage rock, punk rock, hard rock, heavy metal, art rock, new wave, jazz, blues and electronic. Though his popularity has fluctuated, many of Pop's songs have become well known, including ""Search and Destroy"" and ""I Wanna Be Your Dog"" by the Stooges, and his solo hits ""Lust for Life"", ""The Passenger"" and ""Real Wild Child (Wild One)"". In 1990, he recorded his first and only Top 40 U.S. hit, ""Candy"", a duet with B-52's singer Kate Pierson. Pop's song ""China Girl"" became more widely known when it was re-recorded by co-writer Bowie, who released it as the second single from his most commercially successful album, <i>Let's Dance</i> (1983). Bowie re-recorded and performed many of Pop's songs throughout his career.
</p><p>Although Pop has had limited commercial success, he has remained a culture icon and a significant influence on a wide range of musicians in numerous genres. The Stooges' album <i>Raw Power</i> has proved an influence on artists such as Sex Pistols, the Smiths, and Nirvana. His solo album <i>The Idiot</i> has been cited as a major influence on a number of post-punk, electronic and industrial artists including Depeche Mode, Nine Inch Nails and Joy Division, and was described by Siouxsie Sioux as a ""re-affirmation that our suspicions were true: the man is a genius."" He was inducted as part of the Stooges into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2010. In January 2020, Pop received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.</p>

</p>
<p><b>Robert Sylvester Kelly</b> (born January 8, 1967) is an American singer, songwriter, record producer, and sex offender convicted of racketeering and multiple sex offenses.</p><p>During his recording career, Kelly sold over 75 million records worldwide, making him the most commercially successful male R&amp;B artist of the 1990s and one of the world's best-selling music artists. He won three Grammys for his song ""I Believe I Can Fly"", and was also nominated for his song ""You Are Not Alone"" recorded by Michael Jackson. Critics dubbed him ""the King of R&amp;B"" while he billed himself the ""Pied Piper of R&amp;B"".</p><p>Starting in the 1990s, journalists and alleged victims of Kelly accused him of sexually abusing young fans, including minors, and luring them into inappropriate sexual relationships. The Cook County State's Attorney indicted Kelly in 2002 on child pornography charges, but failed to convict in a resulting 2008 trial. Kelly evaded lasting consequences until the 2019 documentary television series <i>Surviving R. Kelly</i> re-examined accusations of Kelly's sexual misconduct with minors. Backlash led RCA Records to terminate their contract with Kelly. Law enforcement in New York, Chicago, and Minneapolis pursued new criminal cases against Kelly following the documentary. Kelly was arrested on federal charges in July 2019. Denied bail, Kelly has been a federal prisoner since.</p><p>
A 2021 trial in Brooklyn federal court convicted Kelly for violations of the Mann Act and racketeering. A 2022 trial in Chicago federal court convicted Kelly for three child pornography charges and three charges of enticing a minor, but acquitted him of charges of conspiracy to obstruct justice in relation to his 2008 trial. The Brooklyn court sentenced Kelly to 30 years imprisonment; his sentencing in Chicago court is slated for February 2023. As of September 2022, Kelly is an inmate of Metropolitan Correctional Center, Chicago. He continues to challenge his two convictions.</p>

</p>
<p><b>Thomas Alan Waits</b> (born December 7, 1949) is an American musician, composer, songwriter, and actor. His lyrics often focus on the underbelly of society and are delivered in his trademark deep, gravelly voice. He worked primarily in jazz during the 1970s, but his music since the 1980s has reflected greater influence from blues, rock, vaudeville, and experimental genres.
</p><p>Waits was born and raised in a middle-class family in California. Inspired by the work of Bob Dylan and the Beat Generation, he began singing on the San Diego folk music circuit as a young man. He relocated to Los Angeles in 1972, where he worked as a songwriter before signing a recording contract with Asylum Records. His first albums were the jazz-oriented <i>Closing Time</i> (1973) and <i>The Heart of Saturday Night</i> (1974), which reflected his lyrical interest in nightlife, poverty, and criminality. He repeatedly toured the United States, Europe, and Japan, and attracted greater critical recognition and commercial success with <i>Small Change</i> (1976), <i>Blue Valentine</i> (1978), and <i>Heartattack and Vine</i> (1980). He produced the soundtrack for Francis Ford Coppola's film <i>One from the Heart</i> (1981), and subsequently made cameo appearances in several Coppola films.
</p><p>In 1980, Waits married Kathleen Brennan, split from his manager and record label, and moved to New York City. With Brennan's encouragement and frequent collaboration, he pursued a more experimental and eclectic musical aesthetic influenced by the work of Harry Partch and Captain Beefheart. This was reflected in a series of albums released by Island Records, including <i>Swordfishtrombones</i> (1983), <i>Rain Dogs</i> (1985), and <i>Franks Wild Years</i> (1987). He continued appearing in films, notably starring in Jim Jarmusch's <i>Down by Law</i> (1986), and also made theatrical appearances. With theatre director Robert Wilson, he produced the musicals <i>The Black Rider</i> (1990) and <i>Alice</i> (1992), first performed in Hamburg. Having returned to California in the 1990s, his albums <i>Bone Machine</i> (1992), <i>The Black Rider</i> (1993), and <i>Mule Variations</i> (1999) earned him increasing critical acclaim and multiple Grammy Awards. In the late 1990s, he switched to the record label ANTI-, which released <i>Blood Money</i> (2002), <i>Alice</i> (2002), <i>Real Gone</i> (2004), and <i>Bad as Me</i> (2011).
</p><p>Despite a lack of mainstream commercial success, Waits has influenced many musicians and gained an international cult following, and several biographies have been written about him.  In 2015, he was ranked at No. 55 on <i>Rolling Stone</i><span>'s</span> ""100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time"". He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2011.

</p>
<p><b>Charles Edward Anderson Berry</b> (October 18, 1926 – March 18, 2017) was an American singer, songwriter and guitarist who pioneered rock and roll. Nicknamed the ""Father of Rock and Roll"", he refined and developed rhythm and blues into the major elements that made rock and roll distinctive with songs such as ""Maybellene"" (1955), ""Roll Over Beethoven"" (1956), ""Rock and Roll Music"" (1957) and ""Johnny B. Goode"" (1958). Writing lyrics that focused on teen life and consumerism, and developing a music style that included guitar solos and showmanship, Berry was a major influence on subsequent rock music.</p><p>Born into a middle-class black family in St. Louis, Berry had an interest in music from an early age and gave his first public performance at Sumner High School. While still a high school student, he was convicted of armed robbery and was sent to a reformatory, where he was held from 1944 to 1947. After his release, Berry settled into married life and worked at an automobile assembly plant. By early 1953, influenced by the guitar riffs and showmanship techniques of the blues musician T-Bone Walker, Berry began performing with the Johnnie Johnson Trio. His break came when he traveled to Chicago in May 1955 and met Muddy Waters, who suggested he contact Leonard Chess, of Chess Records. With Chess, he recorded ""Maybellene""—Berry's adaptation of the country song ""Ida Red""—which sold over a million copies, reaching number one on <i>Billboard</i> magazine's rhythm and blues chart.</p><p>By the end of the 1950s, Berry was an established star, with several hit records and film appearances and a lucrative touring career. He had also established his own St. Louis nightclub, Berry's Club Bandstand. He was sentenced to three years in prison in January 1962 for offenses under the Mann Act—he had transported a 14-year-old girl across state lines for the purpose of having sexual intercourse. After his release in 1963, Berry had several more successful songs, including ""No Particular Place to Go"", ""You Never Can Tell"", and ""Nadine"". However, these did not achieve the same success or lasting impact of his 1950s songs, and by the 1970s he was more in demand as a nostalgia performer, playing his past material with local backup bands of variable quality. In 1972 he reached a new level of achievement when a rendition of ""My Ding-a-Ling"" became his only record to top the charts. His insistence on being paid in cash led in 1979 to a four-month jail sentence and community service, for tax evasion.
</p><p>Berry was among the first musicians to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on its opening in 1986; he was cited for having ""laid the groundwork for not only a rock and roll sound but a rock and roll stance."" Berry is included in several of <i>Rolling Stone</i> magazine's ""greatest of all time"" lists; he was ranked fifth on its 2004 and 2011 lists of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll includes three of Berry's: ""Johnny B. Goode"", ""Maybellene"", and ""Rock and Roll Music"". ""Johnny B. Goode"" is the only rock-and-roll song included on the Voyager Golden Record.</p>"

<p><b>Nicholas Rodney Drake</b> (19 June 1948 – 25 November 1974) was an English singer-songwriter known for his acoustic guitar-based songs. He did not find a wide audience during his lifetime, but his work gradually achieved wider notice and recognition. Drake signed to Island Records when he was 20 years old and a student at the University of Cambridge. He released his debut album, <i>Five Leaves Left</i>, in 1969. He recorded two more albums—<i>Bryter Layter</i> (1971) and <i>Pink Moon</i> (1972). Neither sold more than 5,000 copies on initial release. His reluctance to perform live, or be interviewed, contributed to his lack of commercial success. There is no known video footage of the adult Drake; he was only ever captured in still photographs and in home footage from his childhood.</p><p>Drake experienced depression, particularly during the latter part of his life, a fact often reflected in his lyrics. On completion of his third album, 1972's <i>Pink Moon</i>, he withdrew from both live performance and recording, retreating to his parents' home in rural Warwickshire. On 25 November 1974, Drake died from an overdose of a prescribed antidepressant; he was 26 years old. Whether his death was an accident or suicide has not been resolved.
</p><p>Drake's music remained available through the mid-1970s, but the 1979 release of the retrospective album <i>Fruit Tree</i> allowed his back catalogue to be reassessed. By the mid-1980s, Drake was being credited as an influence by such artists as Robert Smith of The Cure and Peter Buck of R.E.M. In 1985, The Dream Academy reached the UK and US charts with ""Life in a Northern Town"", a song written for and dedicated to Drake. By the early 1990s, he had come to represent a certain type of ""doomed romantic"" musician in the UK music press and was frequently cited as an influence by artists including Kate Bush, Paul Weller, Aimee Mann, Beck, Robyn Hitchcock and The Black Crowes. Drake's first biography appeared in 1997, followed in 1998 by the documentary film <i>A Stranger Among Us</i>.

</p>

<p><b>Otis Ray Redding Jr.</b> (September 9, 1941 – December 10, 1967) was an American singer and songwriter. He is regarded as one of the greatest singers in the history of American popular music and a seminal artist in soul music and rhythm and blues. Nicknamed the ""King of Soul"", Redding's style of singing gained inspiration from the gospel music that preceded the genre. His singing style influenced many other soul artists of the 1960s.
</p><p>Redding was born in Dawson, Georgia, and at age two, moved to Macon. Redding quit school at age 15 to support his family, working with Little Richard's backing band, the Upsetters, and by performing in talent shows at the historic Douglass Theatre in Macon. In 1958, he joined Johnny Jenkins's band, the Pinetoppers, with whom he toured the Southern states as a singer and driver. An unscheduled appearance on a Stax recording session led to a contract and his first hit single, ""These Arms of Mine"", in 1962.
</p><p>Stax released Redding's debut album, <i>Pain in My Heart</i>, two years later. Initially popular mainly with African-Americans, Redding later reached a wider American pop music audience. Along with his group, he first played small shows in the American South. Redding later performed at the popular Los Angeles night club Whisky a Go Go and toured Europe, performing in London, Paris and other major cities. He also performed at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967.
</p><p>Shortly before his death in a plane crash, Redding wrote and recorded his iconic ""(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay"" with Steve Cropper. The song became the first posthumous number-one record on both the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 and R&amp;B charts. The album <i>The Dock of the Bay</i> was the first posthumous album to reach number one on the UK Albums Chart. Redding's premature death devastated Stax. Already on the verge of bankruptcy, the label soon discovered that the Atco division of Atlantic Records owned the rights to his entire song catalog.
</p><p>Redding received many posthumous accolades, including two Grammy Awards, the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the Black Music &amp; Entertainment Walk of Fame. and the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In addition to ""(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay"", ""Respect"" and ""Try a Little Tenderness"" are among his best-known songs.

<p><b>Leonard Norman Cohen</b>  (September 21, 1934 – November 7, 2016) was a Canadian singer-songwriter, poet, and novelist. Themes commonly explored throughout his work include faith and mortality, isolation and depression, betrayal and redemption, social and political conflict, and sexual and romantic love, desire, regret, and loss. He was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame, the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He was invested as a Companion of the Order of Canada, the nation's highest civilian honour. In 2011, he received one of the Prince of Asturias Awards for literature and the ninth Glenn Gould Prize.
</p><p>Cohen pursued a career as a poet and novelist during the 1950s and early 1960s, and did not begin a music career until 1967. His first album, <i>Songs of Leonard Cohen</i> (1967), was followed by three more albums of folk music: <i>Songs from a Room</i> (1969), <i>Songs of Love and Hate</i> (1971) and <i>New Skin for the Old Ceremony</i> (1974). His 1977 record <i>Death of a Ladies' Man</i>, co-written and produced by Phil Spector, was a move away from Cohen's previous minimalist sound.
</p><p>In 1979, Cohen returned with the more traditional <i>Recent Songs</i>, which blended his acoustic style with jazz, East Asian, and Mediterranean influences. Cohen's most famous song, ""Hallelujah"", was released on his seventh album, <i>Various Positions</i> (1984). <i>I'm Your Man</i> in 1988 marked Cohen's turn to synthesized productions. In 1992, Cohen released its follow-up, <i>The Future</i>, which had dark lyrics and references to political and social unrest.

</p>
<p><b>Alice Cooper</b> (born <b>Vincent Damon Furnier</b>, February 4, 1948) is an American rock singer whose career spans over five decades. With a raspy voice and a stage show that features numerous props and stage illusions, including pyrotechnics, guillotines, electric chairs, fake blood, reptiles, baby dolls, and dueling swords, Cooper is considered by many music journalists and peers to be ""The Godfather of Shock Rock"". He has drawn equally from horror films, vaudeville, and garage rock to pioneer a macabre and theatrical brand of rock designed to shock audiences.</p><p>Originating in Phoenix, Arizona, in 1964, ""Alice Cooper"" was originally a band with roots extending back to a band called the Earwigs, consisting of Furnier on lead vocals and harmonica, Glen Buxton on lead guitar, and Dennis Dunaway on bass guitar and backing vocals. By 1966, Michael Bruce on rhythm guitar joined the three and Neal Smith was added on drums in 1967. The five named the band ""Alice Cooper"", and Furnier eventually adopted it as his stage pseudonym. They released their 1969 debut studio album with limited chart success. Breaking out with the 1970 single ""I'm Eighteen"" and the third studio album <i>Love It to Death</i>, the band reached their commercial peak in 1973 with their sixth studio album, <i>Billion Dollar Babies</i>. After the band broke up, Furnier legally changed his name to Alice Cooper and began a solo career in 1975 with the concept album <i>Welcome to My Nightmare</i>. Over his career, Cooper has sold well over 50 million records.</p><p>Cooper has experimented with a number of musical styles, mainly hard rock, glam rock, heavy metal, and glam metal, but also new wave (1980–1983), art rock on <i>DaDa</i> (1983), and industrial rock on <i>Brutal Planet</i> (2000) and <i>Dragontown</i> (2001). He helped to shape the sound and look of heavy metal, and has been described as the artist who ""first introduced horror imagery to rock'n'roll, and whose stagecraft and showmanship have permanently transformed the genre"". He is also known for his wit offstage, with <i>The Rolling Stone Album Guide</i> calling him the world's most ""beloved heavy metal entertainer"". Away from music, Cooper is a film actor, a golfing celebrity, a restaurateur, and, since 2004, a radio disc jockey (DJ) with his classic rock show <i>Nights with Alice Cooper</i>.

Stewart has had 16 top ten singles in the US, with four reaching number one on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. He was knighted in the 2016 Birthday Honours for services to music and charity.</p><p>Stewart's music career began in 1962 when he took up busking with a harmonica. In 1963, he joined The Dimensions as a harmonica player and vocalist. In 1964, Stewart joined Long John Baldry and the All Stars before moving to the Jeff Beck Group in 1967. Joining Faces in 1969, he also maintained a solo career releasing his debut album that year. Stewart's early albums were a fusion of rock, folk music, soul music, and R&amp;B.  His third album, 1971's <i>Every Picture Tells a Story</i>, was his breakthrough, topping the charts in the UK, US, Canada and Australia, as did its ballad ""Maggie May"". His 1972 follow-up album, <i>Never a Dull Moment</i>, also reached number one in the UK and Australia, while going top three in the US and Canada. Its single, ""You Wear It Well"", topped the chart in the UK and was a moderate hit elsewhere.
</p><p>After Stewart had a handful more UK top ten hits, the Faces broke up in 1975. Stewart's next few hit singles were ballads with ""Sailing"", off the 1975 UK and Australian number-one album, <i>Atlantic Crossing</i>, becoming a hit in the UK and the Netherlands (number one), Germany (number four) and other countries, but barely charting in North America. <i>A Night on the Town</i> (1976), his fifth straight chart-topper in the UK, began a three-album run of going number one or top three in the US, Canada, the UK and Australia with each release.

The single ""Rhythm of My Heart"" was a top five hit in the UK, US and other countries, with its source album, 1991's <i>Vagabond Heart</i>, becoming, at number ten in the US and number two in the UK, his highest-charting album in a decade.

</p>

<p><b>Paul Frederic Simon</b> (born October 13, 1941) is an American musician, singer, songwriter and actor whose career has spanned six decades. He is one of the most acclaimed songwriters in popular music, both as a solo artist and as half of folk rock duo Simon &amp; Garfunkel with Art Garfunkel.
</p><p>Simon was born in Newark, New Jersey, and grew up in the borough of Queens in New York City. He began performing with his schoolfriend Art Garfunkel in 1956 when they were still in their early teens. After limited success, the pair reunited after an electrified version of their song ""The Sound of Silence"" became a hit in 1966. Simon &amp; Garfunkel recorded five albums together featuring songs mostly written by Simon, including the hits ""Mrs. Robinson"", ""America"", ""Bridge over Troubled Water"" and ""The Boxer"".</p><p>After Simon &amp; Garfunkel split in 1970, Simon recorded three acclaimed albums over the following five years, all of which charted in the Top 5 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200. His 1972 self-titled album contained the hit songs ""Mother and Child Reunion"" and ""Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard"". The 1975 album <i>Still Crazy After All These Years</i>, which featured guest vocals from Garfunkel, was his first number one solo album. It featured the number 1 hit single ""50 Ways to Leave Your Lover"", among other Top 40 songs such as ""Still Crazy After All These Years"", ""Gone at Last"" and ""My Little Town"".
</p><p>Simon reunited with Garfunkel for a performance in New York Central Park in 1981, drawing half a million spectators, followed by a world tour with Garfunkel. After a career slump, Simon released <i>Graceland</i> in 1986, an album inspired by South African township music. It sold 14 million copies worldwide, and remains his most popular and acclaimed solo work. A number of hit singles were released from the album, including ""You Can Call Me Al"", ""The Boy in the Bubble"" and ""Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes"". It won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1987.
</p><p>Simon continued to tour throughout the 1990s. He wrote a Broadway musical, <i>The Capeman,</i> and recorded a companion album, <i>Songs from The Capeman</i>, which was released in 1997. His 2000 album <i>You're the One</i> was nominated again for Album of the Year honors. He followed that album with several years of touring, including another reunion tour with Garfunkel. He then released <i>Surprise</i> (2006), his last album of the decade. In 2016, he released <i>Stranger to Stranger</i>, which debuted at number 3 on the Billboard Album Chart and number 1 the UK Albums Chart. It marked his greatest commercial and critical success in thirty years. His most recent album is <i>In the Blue Light</i> (2018), which contains re-arrangements of lesser-known songs from his prior albums.
</p><p>Simon has earned sixteen Grammy Awards for his solo and collaborative work, including three for Album of the Year (<i>Bridge Over Troubled Water</i>, <i>Still Crazy After All These Years</i> and <i>Graceland</i>), and a Lifetime Achievement Award. He is a two-time inductee into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame: first in 1990 as a member of Simon &amp; Garfunkel, and again in 2001 for his solo career. In 2006 he was selected as one of the ""100 People Who Shaped the World"" by <i>Time</i>. In 2011, <i>Rolling Stone</i> named Simon one of the 100 greatest guitarists, and in 2015 he was ranked 8th in their list of the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time. Simon was the first recipient of the Library of Congress's Gershwin Prize for Popular Song in 2007.</p>

<p><b>Enya Patricia Brennan</b> (<span></span>; Irish: <i lang=""ga"">Eithne Pádraigín Ní Bhraonáin</i>; born 17 May 1961), known professionally as <b>Enya</b>, is an Irish singer-songwriter and musician known for modern Celtic music. She is the best-selling Irish solo artist in history and the second-best-selling Irish act after U2.
</p><p>Born into a musical family and raised in the Irish-speaking area of Gweedore, County Donegal, Enya began her career in 1980 when she joined her family's Celtic folk band Clannad. She left Clannad in 1982 to pursue a solo career with Clannad's manager and producer Nicky Ryan and Ryan's wife Roma Ryan as her lyricist. Over the following four years, Enya developed her sound with multitracked vocals and keyboards, with elements of Celtic, classical, church, new age, world, pop, and Irish folk music.
</p><p>Enya's first solo projects included soundtrack work for <i>The Frog Prince</i> (1984) and the BBC documentary series <i>The Celts</i>, which was released as her debut album, <i>Enya</i> (1987). She signed with Warner Music UK, which granted her considerable artistic freedom and minimal interference. The commercial and critical success of <i>Watermark</i> (1988) propelled her to worldwide fame, helped by the international hit single ""Orinoco Flow"". This was followed by the multi-million-selling albums <i>Shepherd Moons</i> (1991), <i>The Memory of Trees</i> (1995), and <i>A Day Without Rain</i> (2000). Sales of <i>A Day Without Rain</i> and its lead single, ""Only Time"", surged in the United States following its use in the media coverage of the September 11 attacks. After <i>Amarantine</i> (2005) and <i>And Winter Came...</i> (2008), Enya took a four-year break from music. She returned in 2012 and released her eighth album, <i>Dark Sky Island</i> (2015).
</p><p>Enya's discography has sold 26.5 million certified albums in the United States and an estimated 80 million records worldwide, making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time. <i>A Day Without Rain</i> is the best-selling new-age album, with an estimated 16 million copies sold worldwide.

<p><b>Yusuf Islam</b> (born <b>Steven Demetre Georgiou</b>; <span>21 July 1948</span>), commonly known by his stage names <b>Cat Stevens</b>, <b>Yusuf</b>, and <b>Yusuf / Cat Stevens</b>,  is a British singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist. His musical style consists of folk, pop, rock, and, later in his career, Islamic music. Following two decades in which he only performed music which met strict religious standards, he returned to making secular music in 2006. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2014.</p><p>His 1967 debut album and its title song ""Matthew and Son"" both reached top ten in the UK charts. Stevens' albums <i>Tea for the Tillerman</i> (1970) and <i>Teaser and the Firecat</i> (1971) were certified triple platinum in the US.  His 1972 album <i>Catch Bull at Four</i> went to No.1 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 and spent weeks at the top of several other major charts. He earned ASCAP songwriting awards in 2005 and 2006 for ""The First Cut Is the Deepest"", which has been a hit for four artists. His other hit songs include ""Father and Son"", ""Wild World"", ""Moonshadow"", ""Peace Train"", and ""Morning Has Broken"".
</p><p>Stevens converted to Islam in December 1977, and adopted the name Yusuf Islam the following year. In 1979, he auctioned all of his guitars for charity, and left his musical career to devote himself to educational and philanthropic causes in the Muslim community. He has since bought back at least one of these guitars as a result of the efforts of his son Yoriyos. He was embroiled in a long-running controversy regarding comments he made in 1989, about the death fatwa placed on author Salman Rushdie in response to the publication of Rushdie's novel <i>The Satanic Verses</i>. His current stance is that he never supported the fatwa: ""I was cleverly framed by certain questions. I never supported the fatwa."" He has received two honorary doctorates and awards for promoting peace as well as other humanitarian awards.
</p><p>In 2006, he returned to pop music by releasing his first new studio album of new pop songs in 28 years, entitled <i>An Other Cup</i>. With that release and subsequent ones, he dropped the surname ""Islam"" from the album cover art – using the stage name Yusuf as a mononym. In 2009, he released the album <i>Roadsinger</i> and, in 2014, he released the album <i>Tell 'Em I'm Gone</i> and began his first US tour since 1978.  His second North American tour since his resurgence, featuring 12 shows in intimate venues, ran from 12 September to 7 October 2016. In 2017, he released the album <i>The Laughing Apple</i>, now using the stage name Yusuf / Cat Stevens, using the Cat Stevens name for the first time in 39 years. In September 2020, he released <i>Tea for the Tillerman 2</i>, a reimagining of his classic album <i>Tea for the Tillerman</i> to celebrate its 50th anniversary.

</p>
<p><b>George Harrison</b>  (25 February 1943 – 29 November 2001) was an English musician and singer-songwriter who achieved international fame as the lead guitarist of the Beatles. Sometimes called ""the quiet Beatle"", Harrison embraced Indian culture and helped broaden the scope of popular music through his incorporation of Indian instrumentation and Hindu-aligned spirituality in the Beatles' work. Although the majority of the band's songs were written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contained at least two Harrison compositions. His songs for the group include ""Taxman"", ""Within You Without You"", ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"", ""Here Comes the Sun"" and ""Something"".
</p><p>Harrison's earliest musical influences included George Formby and Django Reinhardt; Carl Perkins, Chet Atkins and Chuck Berry were subsequent influences. By 1965, he had begun to lead the Beatles into folk rock through his interest in Bob Dylan and the Byrds, and towards Indian classical music through his use of Indian instruments, such as sitar, which he had become acquainted with on the set of the movie <i>Help!</i> He played the sitar on numerous Beatles songs, starting with ""Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)"". Having initiated the band's embracing of Transcendental Meditation in 1967, he subsequently developed an association with the Hare Krishna movement. After the band's break-up in 1970, Harrison released the triple album <i>All Things Must Pass</i>, a critically acclaimed work that produced his most successful hit single, ""My Sweet Lord"", and introduced his signature sound as a solo artist, the slide guitar. He also organised the 1971 Concert for Bangladesh with Indian musician Ravi Shankar, a precursor to later benefit concerts such as Live Aid. In his role as a music and film producer, Harrison produced acts signed to the Beatles' Apple record label before founding Dark Horse Records in 1974; he co-founded HandMade Films in 1978, initially to produce the Monty Python troupe's comedy film <i>The Life of Brian</i> (1979).
</p><p>Harrison released several best-selling singles and albums as a solo performer. In 1988, he co-founded the platinum-selling supergroup the Traveling Wilburys. A prolific recording artist, he was featured as a guest guitarist on tracks by Badfinger, Ronnie Wood and Billy Preston, and collaborated on songs and music with Dylan, Eric Clapton, Ringo Starr and Tom Petty, among others. <i>Rolling Stone</i> magazine ranked him number 11 in their list of the ""100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time"". He is a two-time Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee – as a member of the Beatles in 1988, and posthumously for his solo career in 2004.</p><p>Harrison's first marriage, to model Pattie Boyd in 1966, ended in divorce in 1977. The following year he married Olivia Arias, with whom he had a son, Dhani. Harrison died from lung cancer in 2001 at the age of 58, two years after surviving a knife attack by an intruder at his home, Friar Park. His remains were cremated, and the ashes were scattered according to Hindu tradition in a private ceremony in the Ganges and Yamuna rivers in India. He left an estate of almost £100 million.

</p>
<p><b>Janet Damita Jo Jackson</b> (born May 16, 1966) is an American singer, songwriter, actress, and dancer. She is noted for her innovative, socially conscious and sexually provocative records, as well as elaborate stage shows. Her sound and choreography became a catalyst in the growth of MTV, enabling her to rise to prominence while breaking gender and racial barriers in the process. Lyrical content which focused on social issues and lived experiences set her reputation as a role model for youth.
</p><p>The tenth and youngest child of the Jackson family, she made her debut at the MGM Grand. She starred in the variety television series <i>The Jacksons</i> in 1976 and went on to appear in other television shows throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, including <i>Good Times</i>, <i>Diff'rent Strokes</i>, and <i>Fame</i>. After signing a recording contract with A&amp;M Records in 1982, she became a pop icon following the release of her third and fourth studio albums <i>Control</i> (1986) and <i>Rhythm Nation 1814</i> (1989). Her collaborations with record producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis incorporated elements of rhythm and blues, funk, disco, rap, and industrial beats, which led to crossover success in popular music.
</p><p>In 1991, Jackson signed the first of two record-breaking multimillion-dollar contracts with Virgin Records, establishing her as one of the highest-paid artists in the industry. Prior to her first studio project with Virgin, she appeared in her first of several lead film roles in <i>Poetic Justice</i> (1993). Her two studio albums which followed, <i>Janet</i> (1993) and <i>The Velvet Rope</i> (1997), saw her develop a public image as a sex symbol. These records, along with their promotional music videos and live performances in concert tours, branded Jackson as one of the world's most erotic performers, garnering both criticism and praise. By the end of the 1990s, she was named by <i>Billboard</i> magazine as the second most successful recording artist of the decade in the United States after Mariah Carey. The release of her seventh studio album <i>All for You</i> in 2001 coincided with a celebration of her impact on the recording industry as the subject of the inaugural <i>MTV Icon</i> special.</p><p>The backlash from the 2004 Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy resulted in an industry blacklisting under the direction of Les Moonves, then-CEO of CBS Corporation. Jackson subsequently experienced reduced radio airplay, televised promotion and sales figures from that point forward. After parting ways with Virgin Records, she released her tenth studio album <i>Discipline</i> (2008), her first and only album with Island Records. In 2015, she partnered with BMG Rights Management to launch her own record label, Rhythm Nation and released her eleventh studio album <i>Unbreakable</i> the same year. Since then she has continued to release music as an independent artist.
</p><p>Jackson has sold over 100 million records, making her one of the world's best-selling music artists. She has amassed an extensive catalog, with singles such as ""Nasty"", ""Rhythm Nation"", ""That's the Way Love Goes"", ""Together Again"", and ""All for You""; she holds the record for the most consecutive top-ten entries on the US <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 singles chart by a female artist with 18. She is also the only artist in the history of the chart to have seven commercial singles from one album (<i>Rhythm Nation 1814</i>) peak within the top five positions. In 2008, <i>Billboard</i> placed her number seven on its list of the Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists, and in 2010 ranked her fifth among the ""Top 50 R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Artists of the Past 25 Years"". In December 2016, the magazine named her the second most successful dance club artist after Madonna. One of the world's most awarded artists, her accolades include five Grammy Awards, eleven <i>Billboard</i> Music Awards, eleven American Music Awards, a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and eight <i>Guinness World Records</i> entries.

Morrissey,Steven Patrick Morrissey,1959|05|22,Davyhulme,1976–present,,Morrissey,"<link rel=""mw-deduplicated-inline-style"" href=""mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096"">
<p class=""mw-empty-elt"">


</p>

<p><b>Steven Patrick Morrissey</b> (<span></span> <i title=""English pronunciation respelling""><span>MORR</span>-iss-ee</i>; born 22 May 1959), known professionally as just <b>Morrissey</b>, is an English singer and songwriter. He came to prominence as the frontman and lyricist of rock band The Smiths, who were active from 1982 to 1987. Since then, he has pursued a successful solo career. Morrissey's music is characterised by his baritone voice and distinctive lyrics with recurring themes of emotional isolation, sexual longing, self-deprecating and dark humour, and anti-establishment stances.
</p><p>Morrissey was born to working-class Irish immigrants in Davyhulme, Lancashire, England; and later grew up in nearby Manchester. As a child, he developed a love of literature, kitchen sink realism, and 1960s pop music. In the late 1970s, he fronted the punk rock band The Nosebleeds with little success before beginning a career in music journalism and writing several books on music and film in the early 1980s. He formed The Smiths with Johnny Marr in 1982 and the band soon attracted national recognition for their eponymous debut album. As the band's frontman, Morrissey attracted attention for his trademark quiff and witty and sardonic lyrics. Deliberately avoiding rock machismo, he cultivated the image of a sexually ambiguous social outsider who embraced celibacy. The Smiths released three further studio albums—<i>Meat Is Murder</i>, <i>The Queen Is Dead</i>, and <i>Strangeways, Here We Come</i>—and had a string of hit singles. The band were critically acclaimed and attracted a cult following. Personal differences between Morrissey and Marr resulted in the separation of the Smiths in 1987.
</p><p>In 1988 Morrissey launched his solo career with <i>Viva Hate</i>. This album and its follow-ups—<i>Kill Uncle</i>, <i>Your Arsenal</i>, and <i>Vauxhall and I</i>—all did well on the UK Albums Chart and spawned multiple hit singles. He took on Alain Whyte and Boz Boorer as his main co-writers to replace Marr. During this time his image began to shift into that of a burlier figure who toyed with patriotic imagery and working-class masculinity. In the mid-to-late 1990s, his albums <i>Southpaw Grammar</i> and <i>Maladjusted</i> also charted but were less well received. Relocating to Los Angeles, he took a musical hiatus from 1998 to 2003 before releasing a successful comeback album, <i>You Are the Quarry</i>, in 2004. Ensuing years saw the release of albums <i>Ringleader of the Tormentors</i>, <i>Years of Refusal</i>, <i>World Peace Is None of Your Business</i>, <i>Low in High School</i>, <i>California Son</i>, and <i>I Am Not a Dog on a Chain</i>, as well as his autobiography and his debut novel, <i>List of the Lost</i>.
</p><p>Highly influential, Morrissey has been credited as a seminal figure in the emergence of indie rock and Britpop. In a 2006 poll for the BBC's <i>Culture Show</i>, Morrissey was voted the second-greatest living British cultural icon. His work has been the subject of academic study. He has been a controversial figure throughout his music career due to his forthright opinions and outspoken nature-endorsing vegetarianism and animal rights, criticising royalty and prominent politicians. Morrissey has also held controversial views, such as supporting far-right activism with regard to British heritage, and defending a particular vision of national identity, critiquing the effect of immigration on the UK.</p>

</p>
<p><b>Billie Holiday</b> (born <b>Eleanora Fagan</b>; April 7, 1915 – July 17, 1959) was an American jazz and swing music singer. Nicknamed ""<b>Lady Day</b>"" by her friend and music partner, Lester Young, Holiday had an innovative influence on jazz music and pop singing. Her vocal style, strongly inspired by jazz instrumentalists, pioneered a new way of manipulating phrasing and tempo. She was known for her vocal delivery and improvisational skills.</p><p>After a turbulent childhood, Holiday began singing in nightclubs in Harlem, where she was heard by producer John Hammond, who liked her voice. She signed a recording contract with Brunswick in 1935. Collaborations with Teddy Wilson produced the hit ""What a Little Moonlight Can Do"", which became a jazz standard. Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, Holiday had mainstream success on labels such as Columbia and Decca. By the late 1940s, however, she was beset with legal troubles and drug abuse. After a short prison sentence, she performed at a sold-out concert at Carnegie Hall.
She was a successful concert performer throughout the 1950s with two further sold-out shows at Carnegie Hall. Because of personal struggles and an altered voice, her final recordings were met with mixed reaction but were mild commercial successes. Her final album, <i>Lady in Satin</i>, was released in 1958. Holiday died of cirrhosis on July 17, 1959, at age 44.
</p><p>Holiday won four Grammy Awards, all of them posthumously, for Best Historical Album. She was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame and the National Rhythm &amp; Blues Hall of Fame. She was also inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame, though not in that genre; the website states that ""Billie Holiday changed jazz forever"". Several films about her life have been released, most recently <i>The United States vs. Billie Holiday</i> (2021).

</p>
<p><b>John Towner Williams</b> KBE (born February 8, 1932) is an American composer, conductor, and pianist. In a career that has spanned seven decades, he has composed some of the most popular, recognizable and critically acclaimed film scores in cinematic history. Williams has won 25 Grammy Awards, seven British Academy Film Awards, five Academy Awards, and four Golden Globe Awards. With 53 Academy Award nominations, he is the second most-nominated individual, after Walt Disney. His compositions are considered the epitome of film music, and he is considered among the greatest composers in the history of cinema.</p><p>Williams has composed for many critically acclaimed and popular movies, including the <i>Star Wars</i> saga, <i>Jaws</i>, <i>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</i>, <i>Superman</i>, <i>E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</i>, the first two <i>Home Alone</i> films, the <i>Indiana Jones</i> films, the first two <i>Jurassic Park</i> films, <i>Schindler's List</i>, <i>Saving Private Ryan</i>, <i>Catch Me If You Can</i>, <i>Seven Years In Tibet</i>, and the first three <i>Harry Potter</i> films. Williams has also composed numerous classical concertos and other works for orchestral ensembles and solo instruments. He served as the Boston Pops' principal conductor from 1980 to 1993 and is its laureate conductor. He has been associated with director Steven Spielberg since 1974, composing music for all but five of his feature films, and George Lucas, with whom he has worked on both of his main franchises. Other works by Williams include theme music for the 1984 Summer Olympic Games, <i>NBC Sunday Night Football</i>, ""The Mission"" theme used by NBC News and Seven News in Australia, the television series <i>Lost in Space</i> and <i>Land of the Giants</i>, and the incidental music for the first season of <i>Gilligan's Island</i>. Williams announced his intention to retire from film score composing after the release of <i>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny</i> in 2023 to focus more on composing independent orchestral and symphonic pieces, though he later rescinded this.</p><p>In 2005, the American Film Institute selected Williams's score to 1977's <i>Star Wars</i> as the greatest film score of all time. The Library of Congress entered the <i>Star Wars</i> soundtrack into the National Recording Registry for being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"". Williams was inducted into the Hollywood Bowl's Hall of Fame in 2000, and he received a Kennedy Center Honor in 2004. His AFI Life Achievement Award in 2016 was the first to be awarded outside of the acting and directing fields. He has composed the score for nine of the top 25 highest-grossing films at the U.S. box office (adjusted for inflation). His work has influenced other composers of film, popular, and contemporary classical music; Norwegian composer Marcus Paus argues that Williams's ""satisfying way of embodying dissonance and avant-garde techniques within a larger tonal framework"" makes him ""one of the great composers of any century"".</p>

<p><b>David Ryan Adams</b> (born November 5, 1974) is an American singer-songwriter, record producer, artist, and poet. He has released 24 studio albums and three as a former member of Whiskeytown.
</p><p>In 2000, Adams left Whiskeytown and released his debut solo album, <i>Heartbreaker</i>, to critical acclaim. The album was nominated for the Shortlist Music Prize. The following year, his profile increased with the release of the UK certified-gold <i>Gold</i>, which included the single, ""New York, New York"". During this time, Adams worked on several unreleased albums, which were consolidated into a third solo release, <i>Demolition</i> (2002). Working at a prolific rate, Adams released the classic rock-influenced <i>Rock N Roll</i> (2003), after a planned album, <i>Love Is Hell</i>, was rejected by his label Lost Highway. As a compromise, <i>Love Is Hell</i> was released as two EPs and eventually released in its full-length state in 2004.
</p><p>After breaking his wrist during a live performance, Adams took a short break, and formed The Cardinals, a backing band that accompanied him on his next four studio albums. In 2009, after the release of <i>Cardinology</i> (2009), Adams disbanded The Cardinals and announced an extended break from music due to complications from Ménière's disease.

The album peaked at No. 7 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200. In September 2014, Adams released his fourteenth album, <i>Ryan Adams</i>, on his own PAX AM label, and formed a new backing band, The Shining, to support the release.
</p><p>In 2015, Adams released <i>1989</i>, a song-for-song cover of Taylor Swift's album of the same name, and worked on up to 80 songs for an album influenced by his divorce from actress and singer-songwriter Mandy Moore. The album, <i>Prisoner</i>, was released in 2017.
</p><p>In 2019, Adams announced three albums to be released that year. However, the release of these albums was indefinitely delayed after seven women came forward with sexual misconduct allegations against him. He later issued an apology, and the FBI cleared him of any potential criminal charges. Adams eventually released the planned albums, <i>Wednesdays</i>, <i>Big Colors</i>, and <i>Chris</i>, yearly from 2020 to 2022. <i>Chris</i> was followed by three further albums, all released in 2022 as well.
</p><p>In addition to his own material, Adams has also produced albums for Willie Nelson, Jesse Malin, Jenny Lewis, and Fall Out Boy, and has collaborated with Counting Crows, Weezer, Norah Jones, America, Minnie Driver, Cowboy Junkies, Leona Naess, Toots and the Maytals, Beth Orton and Krista Polvere.
