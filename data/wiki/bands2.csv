</p>
<p><b>The Stone Roses</b> were an English rock band formed in Manchester in 1983. One of the pioneering groups of the Madchester movement in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the band's classic and most prominent lineup consisted of vocalist Ian Brown, guitarist John Squire, bassist Mani and drummer Reni.
</p><p>The band released their debut album, <i>The Stone Roses</i>, in 1989. The album was a breakthrough success for the band and received critical acclaim, many regarding it as one of the greatest British albums ever recorded. At this time the group decided to capitalise on their success by signing to a major label. Their record label at the time, Silvertone, would not let them out of their contract, which led to a long legal battle that culminated with the band signing with Geffen Records in 1991.
</p><p>The Stone Roses released their second album, <i>Second Coming</i>, in 1994, which received mixed reviews. The group soon disbanded after several line-up changes throughout the supporting tour, which began with Reni departing in early 1995, followed by Squire in April 1996. Brown and Mani dissolved the remains of the group in October 1996 following their appearance at Reading Festival.
</p><p>Following much intensified media speculation, the Stone Roses called a press conference on 18 October 2011 to announce that the band had reunited and would perform a reunion world tour in 2012, including three homecoming shows in Heaton Park, Manchester. Plans to record a third album in the future were also floated but only two singles were released. In June 2012, Chris Coghill, the writer of a new film which is set during the Stone Roses 1990 Spike Island show, revealed that the band ""have at least three or four new tracks recorded"". In June 2013, a documentary about the band's reformation directed by Shane Meadows and titled <i>The Stone Roses: Made of Stone</i> was released.</p><p>In 2016, the Stone Roses released their first new material in two decades. The band members continued to tour until June 2017, at which point cryptic remarks by Brown indicated the band had split again, which was later confirmed in a 2019 interview with Squire.</p>

<p>The <b>Sex Pistols</b> were an English punk rock band formed in London in 1975. Although their initial career lasted just two and a half years, they were one of the most groundbreaking acts in the history of popular music. They were responsible for initiating the punk movement in the United Kingdom and inspiring many later punk and alternative rock musicians. Their fashion and hairstyles were a significant influence on punk image, and they are often associated with anarchism within music.
</p><p>The Sex Pistols originally comprised vocalist Johnny Rotten (John Lydon), guitarist Steve Jones, drummer Paul Cook, and bassist Glen Matlock; Matlock was replaced by Sid Vicious in early 1977. Under the management of Malcolm McLaren, the band attracted some controversies that both captivated and appalled Britain. Through an obscenity-laced television interview in December 1976 and their May 1977 single ""God Save the Queen"", the latter of which attacked Britons' social conformity and deference to the Crown, calling the monarchy a ""fascist regime"". The release of the song popularised punk rock in the UK. ""God Save the Queen"" was banned by the BBC and nearly every independent radio station in Britain, making it one of the most censored records in British history.
</p><p>The Sex Pistols' only album, <i>Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols</i> (1977) — a UK number one — is a staple record of punk rock. In January 1978, at the end of their turbulent tour of the US, Rotten announced the band's break-up. Over the next few months, the three remaining members recorded songs for McLaren's film of the Sex Pistols' story, <i>The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle</i>. Vicious died of a heroin overdose in February 1979, following his arrest for the alleged murder of his girlfriend, Nancy Spungen. A film about the couple, <i>Sid and Nancy</i>, was released in 1986. Rotten, Jones, Cook, and Matlock reunited for a successful tour in 1996. Further one-off performances and short tours followed over the next decade.
</p><p>The Sex Pistols have been recognised as an influential band. In 2004, <i>Rolling Stone</i> placed them No. 58 on its list of the ""100 Greatest Artists of All Time"". On 24 February 2006, the Sex Pistols—the four original members plus Vicious—were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame; they refused to attend the ceremony, calling it ""a piss stain"".</p>

Fredriksson had released a number of solo albums and Gessle was the lead singer and songwriter of Gyllene Tider, a band which had three No. 1 albums. Acting on the advice of the managing director of their record label, the two joined to record ""Neverending Love"", which became a hit single in Sweden.
</p><p>After the release of <i>Don't Bore Us, Get to the Chorus!,</i> a greatest hits record, the duo took a hiatus before returning with the albums <i>Have a Nice Day</i> (1999) and <i>Room Service</i> (2001). They continued to chart in other territories, mainly in Europe, Australia and Latin America, where they earned various Gold and Platinum awards until the beginning of the new millennium. In 2002, the duo took a break from recording and touring when Fredriksson was diagnosed with a brain tumour. Gessle went on to release solo albums and reunited with Gyllene Tider before Roxette took to the stage together again for the first time in eight years, in 2009, during Gessle's European <i>Party Crasher</i> tour. In 2011, they released <i>Charm School</i>, their first studio album in ten years, which was followed by <i>Travelling</i> in 2012. Their final studio album, <i>Good Karma</i>, was released in 2016. Marie Fredriksson died on 9 December 2019, at the age of 61, following a long battle with a brain tumour.
</p><p>Their songs ""It Must Have Been Love"" and ""Listen to Your Heart"" continue to receive wide radio airplay, with both singles receiving awards from BMI in 2014 for achieving five million radio plays. They have sold an estimated 75 million records worldwide, with over 10 million in certified units from Germany, the US and the UK, achieving gold and platinum certifications for <i>Joyride</i> and <i>Look Sharp!</i> in all three regions. They are Sweden's second-best-selling music act after ABBA.</p>

Pulp,Sheffield,,Pulp (band),"<p class=""mw-empty-elt"">

</p>
<p><b>Pulp</b> are an English rock band formed in Sheffield in 1978. Their best-known line-up from their heyday (1992–1997) consisted of Jarvis Cocker (vocals, guitar, keyboards), Russell Senior (guitar, violin), Candida Doyle (keyboards), Nick Banks (drums, percussion), Steve Mackey (bass) and Mark Webber (guitar, keyboards).
</p><p>Throughout the 1980s the band struggled to find success, but gained prominence in the UK in the mid-1990s with the release of the albums <i>His 'n' Hers</i> in 1994 and particularly <i>Different Class</i> in 1995, which reached the number one spot in the UK Albums Chart. The album spawned four top ten singles, including ""Common People"" and ""Sorted for E's &amp; Wizz"", both of which reached number two in the UK Singles Chart. Pulp's musical style during this period consisted of disco-influenced pop-rock coupled with references to British culture in their lyrics in the form of a ""kitchen sink drama""-style. Cocker and the band became reluctant figureheads of the Britpop movement, and were nominated for the Mercury Music Prize in 1994 for <i>His 'n' Hers</i>; they won the prize in 1996 for <i>Different Class</i> and were nominated again in 1998 for <i>This Is Hardcore</i>. Pulp headlined the Pyramid Stage of the Glastonbury Festival twice and were regarded among the Britpop ""big four"", along with Oasis, Blur and Suede.</p><p>The band released <i>We Love Life</i> in 2001 and then took a decade-long break, having sold more than 10 million records. Pulp reunited and played live again in 2011, with dates at the Isle of Wight Festival, Reading and Leeds Festivals, Pohoda, Sziget Festival, Primavera Sound, the Exit festival, and the Wireless Festival. A number of additional concert dates were afterward added to their schedule. In January 2013, Pulp released ""After You"", a song originally demoed for <i>We Love Life</i>, as a digital download single. It was the band's first single release since ""Bad Cover Version"" in 2002. On 9 March 2014, Pulp and filmmaker Florian Habicht premiered the feature documentary <i>Pulp: A Film about Life, Death &amp; Supermarkets</i> at SXSW Music and Film Festival in Austin, Texas. The film toured the international film festival circuit and was released theatrically by  Oscilloscope Laboratories in the US in November 2014. It is the first film about Pulp (and Sheffield) that has been made in collaboration with the band. The band once again went on hiatus following this, but in 2022, Cocker announced that the band would be reuniting for a second time to play a series of shows in 2023.</p>

The Byrds,Los Angeles,1964–1973|1989–1991|2000,The Byrds,"<p class=""mw-empty-elt"">

</p>
<p><b>The Byrds</b> (<span></span>) were an American rock band formed in Los Angeles, California, in 1964. The band underwent multiple lineup changes throughout its existence, with frontman Roger McGuinn (known as Jim McGuinn until mid-1967) remaining the sole consistent member. Although their time as one of the most popular groups in the world only lasted for a short period in the mid-1960s, the Byrds are today considered by critics to be among the most influential rock acts of their era. Their signature blend of clear harmony singing and McGuinn's jangly 12-string Rickenbacker guitar was ""absorbed into the vocabulary of rock"" and has continued to be influential.</p><p>Initially, the Byrds pioneered the musical genre of folk rock as a popular format in 1965, by melding the influence of the Beatles and other British Invasion bands with contemporary and traditional folk music on their first and second albums and the hit singles ""Mr. Tambourine Man"" and ""Turn! Turn! Turn!"".  As the 1960s progressed, the band was influential in originating psychedelic rock and raga rock, with their song ""Eight Miles High"" and the albums <i>Fifth Dimension</i> (1966), <i>Younger Than Yesterday</i> (1967), and <i>The Notorious Byrd Brothers</i> (1968). The band also played a pioneering role in the development of country rock, with the 1968 album <i>Sweetheart of the Rodeo</i> representing their fullest immersion into the genre.</p><p>The original five-piece lineup of the band consisted of McGuinn (lead guitar, vocals), Gene Clark (tambourine, vocals), David Crosby (rhythm guitar, vocals), Chris Hillman (bass guitar, vocals), and Michael Clarke (drums). This version of the band was relatively short-lived and by early 1966 Clark had left due to problems associated with anxiety and his increasing isolation within the group. The Byrds continued as a quartet until late 1967, when Crosby and Clarke also departed. McGuinn and Hillman decided to recruit new members, including country rock pioneer Gram Parsons, but by late 1968, Hillman and Parsons had also exited the band. McGuinn elected to rebuild the band's membership; between 1968 and 1973, he helmed a new incarnation of the Byrds that featured guitarist Clarence White, among others.  McGuinn disbanded the then-current version of the band in early 1973 to make way for a reunion of the original quintet. The Byrds' final album was released in March 1973, with the reunited group disbanding later that year.</p><p>Several former members of the Byrds went on to successful careers of their own, either as solo artists or as members of such groups as Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young, the Flying Burrito Brothers, McGuinn, Clark &amp; Hillman, and the Desert Rose Band. In 1991, the Byrds were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, an occasion that saw the five original members performing together for the last time. Gene Clark died of a heart attack later that year, while Michael Clarke died of liver failure in 1993. David Crosby died in 2023. McGuinn and Hillman remain active.

Whitesnake,London,,Whitesnake,"<p class=""mw-empty-elt"">


</p>
<p><b>Whitesnake</b> are  an English hard rock band formed in London in 1978. The group was originally put together as the backing band for singer David Coverdale, who had recently left Deep Purple. Though the band quickly developed into their own entity, Coverdale is the only constant member throughout their history.
</p><p>Whitesnake enjoyed much success in the UK, Europe and Japan through their early years. Their albums <i>Ready an' Willing</i>, <i>Come an' Get It</i> and <i>Saints &amp; Sinners</i> all reached the top ten on the UK Albums Chart. By the mid-1980s, however, Coverdale had set his sights on breaking through in North America, where Whitesnake remained largely unknown. With the backing of American label Geffen Records, Whitesnake released <i>Slide It In</i> in 1984, followed by an eponymous album in 1987, which became their biggest success to date, selling over eight million copies in the US and spawning the hit singles ""Here I Go Again"" and ""Is This Love"". 
</p><p>Whitesnake also adopted a more contemporary look, akin to the Los Angeles glam metal scene. After releasing <i>Slip of the Tongue</i> in 1989, Coverdale decided to put Whitesnake on hold to take a break from the music industry. Aside from a few short-lived reunions in the 1990s, Whitesnake remained mostly inactive until 2003, when Coverdale put together a new line-up to celebrate the band's 25th anniversary. Since then Whitesnake have released four more studio albums and toured extensively around the world.
</p><p>Whitesnake's early sound has been characterized by critics as blues rock, but by the mid-1980s the band slowly began moving toward a more commercially accessible hard rock style. Topics such as love and sex are common in Whitesnake's lyrics, which have been criticized for their excessive use of sexual innuendos and double entendres. Whitesnake have been nominated for several awards during their career, including Best British Group at the 1988 Brit Awards. They have also been featured on lists of the greatest hard rock bands of all time by several media outlets, while their songs and albums have appeared on many ""best of"" lists by outlets, such as VH1 and <i>Rolling Stone</i>.</p>",

Antonio Vivaldi,,,Antonio Vivaldi,"<p class=""mw-empty-elt"">
</p>


<p><b>Antonio Lucio Vivaldi</b> (4 March 1678 – 28 July 1741) was a Venetian composer, virtuoso violinist and impresario of Baroque music. Along with Johan Sebastian Bach and Georg Frideric Handel, Vivaldi is regarded as one of the greatest Baroque composers and his influence during his lifetime was widespread across Europe, giving origin to many imitators and admirers. He pioneered many developments in orchestration, violin technique and programatic music. He consolidated the emerging concerto form into a widely accepted and followed idiom, which was paramount in the development of Johann Sebastian Bach's instrumental music.
</p><p>Vivaldi composed many instrumental concertos, for the violin and a variety of other musical instruments, as well as sacred choral works and more than fifty operas. His best-known work is a series of violin concertos known as <i>the Four Seasons</i>. Many of his compositions were written for the all-female music ensemble of the <i>Ospedale della Pietà</i>, a home for abandoned children. Vivaldi began studying for the priesthood at the age of 15 and was ordained at 25, but was given dispensation to no longer say public Masses due to a health problem. Vivaldi also had some success with expensive stagings of his operas in Venice, Mantua and Vienna. After meeting the Emperor Charles VI, Vivaldi moved to Vienna, hoping for royal support. However, the Emperor died soon after Vivaldi's arrival, and Vivaldi himself died in poverty less than a year later.  
</p><p>After almost two centuries of decline, Vivaldi's musical reputation underwent a revival in the early 20th century, with much scholarly research devoted to his work. Many of Vivaldi's compositions, once thought lost, have been rediscovered – in one case as recently as 2006. His music remains widely popular in the present day and is regularly played all over the world.

<p><b>Bad Religion</b> is an American punk rock band that formed in Los Angeles, California, in 1980. The band's lyrics cover topics related to religion, politics, society, the media and science. Musically, they are noted for their melodic sensibilities and extensive use of three-part vocal harmonies. The band has experienced multiple line-up changes, with singer Greg Graffin being the band's only constant member, though fellow founding members Jay Bentley and Brett Gurewitz have also been with the band for most of their history while guitarist Brian Baker has been a member of the group since 1994. Guitarist Mike Dimkich and drummer Jamie Miller have been members of the band since 2013 and 2015 respectively. To date, Bad Religion has released seventeen studio albums, two live albums, three compilation albums, three EPs, and two live DVDs. They are considered to be one of the best-selling punk rock acts of all time, having sold over five million albums worldwide.</p><p>After gaining a large underground following and critical praise through their releases on Gurewitz's label Epitaph in the 1980s and early 1990s, Bad Religion experienced mainstream success after signing to the major label Atlantic in 1993. Bad Religion pioneered the punk rock revival movement of the 1990s, establishing a formula for California-based punk bands such as Green Day and Epitaph-signed acts the Offspring, NOFX and Rancid. Atlantic reissued the previously-released-on-Epitaph album, <i>Recipe for Hate</i> (1993), which became commercially successful, as did its 1994 follow-up <i>Stranger than Fiction</i>. <i>Stranger than Fiction</i> included some of Bad Religion's well-known hits, including ""Infected,"" ""Stranger than Fiction,"" and the re-recorded version of ""21st Century (Digital Boy)""; the album was later certified gold in both the United States and Canada.
</p><p>Shortly before the release of <i>Stranger than Fiction,</i> Gurewitz left Bad Religion to run his label Epitaph on a full-time basis, and was replaced by Brian Baker. The band's success had slowly dwindled by the late 1990s, and, after three more albums, they were dropped from Atlantic in 2001. This resulted in Bad Religion returning to Epitaph and Gurewitz rejoining the band. Since then, they have undergone a resurgence in popularity, with ""Sorrow,"" ""Los Angeles Is Burning,"" and ""The Devil in Stitches"" being Top 40 hits on the US charts while their sixteenth studio album, <i>True North</i> (2013), became Bad Religion's first album to crack the top 20 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 chart where it peaked at number 19.

</p>
<p><b>Rush</b> was a Canadian rock band that was comprised primarily of Geddy Lee (bass, vocals), Alex Lifeson (guitar), and Neil Peart (drums, percussion, lyricist). The band was formed in Toronto in 1968 by Lifeson, drummer John Rutsey, and bass guitarist/vocalist Jeff Jones, who was immediately replaced by Lee. After Lee joined, the band went through several line-up configurations before arriving at its classic power trio line-up with the addition of Peart in July 1974, who replaced Rutsey four months after the release of their self-titled debut album; this line-up remained intact for the remainder of the band's career.
</p><p>Rush achieved commercial success in the 1970s with <i>Fly by Night</i> (1975), <i>2112</i> (1976), <i>A Farewell to Kings</i> (1977) and <i>Hemispheres</i> (1978). The band's popularity continued throughout the 1980s and 1990s, with albums charting highly in Canada, the US and the UK, including <i>Permanent Waves</i> (1980), <i>Moving Pictures</i> (1981), <i>Signals</i> (1982), <i>Grace Under Pressure</i> (1984) and <i>Counterparts</i> (1993). Rush continued to record and perform until 1997, after which the band entered a four-year hiatus due to personal tragedies in Peart's life. The trio regrouped in 2001 and released three more studio albums: <i>Vapor Trails</i> (2002), <i>Snakes &amp; Arrows</i> (2007), and <i>Clockwork Angels</i> (2012). Rush ceased touring at the end of 2015, and Lifeson announced in January 2018 that the band would not continue, which was cemented by Peart's death from glioblastoma, a type of brain cancer, on January 7, 2020, at the age of 67.</p><p>Rush were known for their musicianship, complex compositions and eclectic lyrical motifs drawing heavily on science fiction, fantasy and philosophy. The band's style changed over the years, from a blues-inspired hard rock beginning, later moving into progressive rock, then a period in the 1980s marked by heavy use of synthesizers, before returning to guitar-driven hard rock at the end of the 1980s. Their final work from 2012, marked a return to progressive rock. The members of Rush have been acknowledged as some of the most proficient players on their respective instruments, with each winning numerous awards in magazine readers' polls over the years.

Yes,London,,Yes (band),"<p class=""mw-empty-elt"">


</p>
<p><b>Yes</b> are  an English progressive rock band formed in London in 1968 by lead singer and frontman Jon Anderson, bassist Chris Squire, guitarist Peter Banks, keyboardist Tony Kaye, and drummer Bill Bruford. The band has undergone numerous line-up changes throughout their history, during which 20 musicians have been full-time members. Since February 2023, the band has consisted of guitarist Steve Howe, keyboardist Geoff Downes, bassist Billy Sherwood, singer Jon Davison, and drummer Jay Schellen. Yes have explored several musical styles over the years and are most notably regarded as progressive rock pioneers.
</p><p>Yes began performing original songs and rearranged covers of rock, pop, blues and jazz songs, as evidenced on their self-titled first album from 1969, and its follow-up <i>Time and a Word</i> from 1970. A change of direction later in 1970 led to a series of successful progressive rock albums, with four consecutive U.S. platinum or multi-platinum sellers in <i>The Yes Album</i> (1971), <i>Fragile</i> (1971), <i>Close to the Edge</i> (1972) and the live album <i>Yessongs</i> (1973). Further albums, <i>Tales from Topographic Oceans</i> (1973), <i>Relayer</i> (1974), <i>Going for the One</i> (1977) and <i>Tormato</i> (1978), were also commercially successful. Yes toured as a major rock act that earned the band a reputation for their elaborate stage sets, light displays, and album covers designed by Roger Dean. The success of ""Roundabout"", the single from <i>Fragile</i>, cemented their popularity across the decade and beyond. Anderson and Squire remained with the group throughout the 1970s, with Banks, Kaye, and Bruford all departing across 1970–1972, and being replaced by Howe, Rick Wakeman, and Alan White, respectively. Wakeman would leave the group in 1974, but returned two years later, with Patrick Moraz taking his place in the interim. After a final album, <i>Drama</i>, and tour in 1980, both of which saw Downes and Trevor Horn replace Wakeman and Anderson, respectively, Yes disbanded in 1981.
</p><p>In 1983, Squire and White reformed Yes, with Anderson and Kaye returning, and guitarist Trevor Rabin joining. Rabin's songwriting helped move the band toward a more mainstream rock style. The result was <i>90125</i> (1983), their highest-selling album, featuring the U.S. number-one single ""Owner of a Lonely Heart"". Its follow-up, <i>Big Generator</i> (1987), was also successful. From 1991 to 1992, Yes were an eight-member formation after they merged with spinoff Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe for <i>Union</i> (1991) and its tour. From 1994 to 2004, Yes regularly released albums with varied levels of success. After a four-year hiatus, they resumed touring in 2008 and have released three new albums; their most recent is <i>The Quest</i> (2021). Throughout the long history of Yes, current and former members have often collaborated outside of the official band context; most recently, the group Yes Featuring Jon Anderson, Trevor Rabin, Rick Wakeman toured from 2016 to 2018. Among the longest serving members of the band, Squire died in 2015, and White died in 2022.
</p><p>Yes are one of the most successful, influential, and longest-lasting progressive rock bands. They have sold 13.5 million RIAA-certified albums in the U.S., as well as more than 30 million albums worldwide. In 1985, they won a Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance with ""Cinema"", and received five Grammy nominations between 1985 and 1992. They were ranked No. 94 on VH1's <i>100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock</i>. Their discography spans 22 studio albums. In April 2017, Yes were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, which chose to induct current and former members Anderson, Squire, Bruford, Kaye, Howe, Wakeman, White, and Rabin.

</p>
<p><b>The Allman Brothers Band</b> was an American rock band formed in Jacksonville, Florida in 1969 by brothers Duane Allman (founder, slide guitar and lead guitar) and Gregg Allman (vocals, keyboards, songwriting), as well as Dickey Betts (lead guitar, vocals, songwriting), Berry Oakley (bass), Butch Trucks (drums), and Jai Johanny ""Jaimoe"" Johanson (drums). Subsequently based in Macon, Georgia, they incorporated elements of blues, jazz, and country music, and their live shows featured jam band-style improvisation and instrumentals.
</p><p>Their first two studio releases, <i>The Allman Brothers Band</i> (1969) and <i>Idlewild South</i> (1970) (both released by Capricorn Records), stalled commercially, but their 1971 live release <i>At Fillmore East</i> was an artistic and commercial breakthrough. It features extended versions of their songs ""In Memory of Elizabeth Reed"" and ""Whipping Post"", showcasing the group's jamming style.
</p><p>Group leader Duane Allman was killed in a motorcycle accident later that year – on October 29, 1971 – and the band dedicated <i>Eat a Peach</i> (1972) to his memory, a dual studio/live album that cemented the band's popularity and featured Gregg Allman's ""Melissa"" and Dickey Betts's ""Blue Sky"". Following the motorcycling death of bassist Berry Oakley one year and 13 days later on November 11, 1972, the group recruited keyboardist Chuck Leavell and bassist Lamar Williams for 1973's <i>Brothers and Sisters.</i> The album included Betts's hit single ""Ramblin' Man"" and instrumental ""Jessica"", which went on to become classic rock radio staples and placed the group at the forefront of 1970s rock music. Internal turmoil overtook them soon after; the group dissolved in 1976, reformed briefly at the end of the decade with additional personnel changes, and dissolved again in 1982.
</p><p>The band re-formed once more in 1989, releasing a string of new albums and touring heavily. A series of personnel changes in the late 1990s was capped by the departure of Betts. The group found stability during the 2000s with bassist Oteil Burbridge and guitarists Warren Haynes and Derek Trucks (the nephew of their original drummer) and became renowned for their month-long string of shows at New York City's Beacon Theatre each spring. The band retired for good in October 2014 after their final show at the Beacon Theatre.
</p><p>Butch Trucks died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on January 24, 2017 in West Palm Beach, Florida at the age of 69.

</p>
<p><b>Within Temptation</b> is a Dutch symphonic metal band founded in April 1996 by vocalist Sharon den Adel and guitarist Robert Westerholt. They have been classified by critics as gothic metal and symphonic metal, although each album contains other influences outside these genres. Their most prominent and well-known sound is described as symphonic metal, although their earlier material, such as debut album <i>Enter</i>, was mostly gothic metal, with <i>Enter</i> also having a hint of doom metal. In an interview, den Adel said they fell into a symphonic rock genre with various influences. In another interview, den Adel stated that ""We consider ourselves more an atmospheric melodic symphonic metal/rock band... In my opinion, we are not a gothic band but we have gothic elements"".</p><p>After the release of their debut album <i>Enter</i> in 1997, the band became prominent in the Dutch underground scene. It was not until 2001 that they became known to the general public, with the single ""Ice Queen"" from their second album <i>Mother Earth</i>, which reached No. 2 on the Dutch charts. This was followed by the band winning the Conamus Exportprijs, a Dutch music award, four years in a row, and a fifth in 2016. Their next albums <i>The Silent Force</i> (2004) and <i>The Heart of Everything</i> (2007) debuted at No. 1 on the Dutch charts and expanded their international recognition. In 2008, they released <i>Black Symphony</i>, a live album recorded with the Metropole Orchestra. This was followed in 2009 by <i>An Acoustic Night at the Theatre</i>, another live album, this time with acoustic renditions of the songs.
</p><p>The band's fifth studio album, <i>The Unforgiving</i>, was released in March 2011 and was one part of a transmedia effort, alongside both a comic book series and a series of short films that together encompass a story. The album saw the band increasingly venturing on new musical territories outside symphonic metal. Their sixth studio album, <i>Hydra</i>, was released in early 2014 in Japan, Europe, and the United States. The album advanced the band's exploration of new musical genres and features guest appearances from various artists: Finnish singer Tarja Turunen, who appears in the lead single ""Paradise (What About Us?)""; Howard Jones, former vocalist of American metalcore band Killswitch Engage; Dave Pirner, lead vocalist of American alternative rock band Soul Asylum; and American rapper Xzibit. The band had extensive airplay on BBC Radio 2 in the United Kingdom with one of the songs from the album, ""Whole World Is Watching"" featuring Pirner.
</p><p>Their latest studio album, <i>Resist</i>, was released in February 2019 and incorporates influences from other musical styles such as industrial and EDM. By 2016, the band had already sold more than 3.5 million albums worldwide.</p>

<p><b>T. Rex</b> (originally <b>Tyrannosaurus Rex</b>) were  an English rock band, formed in 1967 by singer-songwriter and guitarist Marc Bolan, who was their leader, frontman and only consistent member. Though initially associated with the psychedelic folk genre, Bolan began to change the band's style towards electric rock in 1969, and shortened their name to T. Rex the following year. This development culminated in 1970 with their first hit single ""Ride a White Swan"", and the group soon became pioneers of the glam rock movement.
</p><p>From 1970 to 1973, T. Rex encountered a popularity in the UK comparable to that of the Beatles, with a run of eleven singles in the UK top ten. They scored four UK number one hits, ""Hot Love"", ""Get It On"", ""Telegram Sam"" and ""Metal Guru"". The band's 1971 album <i>Electric Warrior</i> received critical acclaim, reached number 1 in the UK and became a landmark album in glam rock. The 1972 follow-up, <i>The Slider</i>, entered the top 20 in the US. Bolstering their style with soul music, funk and gospel, the band released <i>Tanx</i> in 1973 which reached the top 5 in several countries.  From 1974, T. Rex's appeal began to wane, though the band continued releasing albums. Their subsequent releases blended rock with R&amp;B and occasionally even disco.
</p><p>In 1977, Bolan died in a car crash several months after the release of the group's final studio album <i>Dandy in the Underworld</i>, and the group disbanded. T.

</p>
<p><b>N.W.A</b> (an abbreviation for <b>Niggaz Wit Attitudes</b>) was an American hip hop group whose members were among the earliest and most significant popularizers and controversial figures of the gangsta rap subgenre, and the group is widely considered one of the greatest and most influential groups in the history of hip hop music.</p><p>Active from 1987 to 1991, the rap group endured controversy owing to its music's explicit lyrics, which many viewed as being misogynistic, as well as to its glorification of drugs and crime. The group was subsequently banned from many mainstream American radio stations. In spite of this, the group has sold over 10 million units in the United States alone. Drawing on its members' own experiences of racism and excessive policing, the group made inherently political music. The group's members were known for their deep hatred of the police system, which has sparked much controversy over the years.
</p><p>The original lineup, formed in early 1987, consisted of Arabian Prince, Dr. Dre, Eazy-E, and Ice Cube, with DJ Yella and MC Ren joining later that year. They released their first compilation album as a group in 1987 called <i>N.W.A. and the Posse</i>, which peaked at No. 39 on <i>Billboard</i> magazine's Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. Arabian Prince left shortly after the release of N.W.A's debut studio album, <i>Straight Outta Compton</i>, in 1988, with Ice Cube following suit in December 1989. Eazy-E, Ice Cube, MC Ren and Dr. Dre later became platinum-selling solo artists in their own right in the 1990s. The group's debut album marked the beginning of the new gangsta rap era as the production and social commentary in their lyrics were revolutionary within the genre. N.W.A's second studio album, <i>Niggaz4Life</i>, was the first hardcore rap album to reach number one on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 sales charts.</p><p><i>Rolling Stone</i> ranked N.W.A at number 83 on its list of the ""100 Greatest Artists of All Time"". In 2016, the group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, following three previous nominations.

These core members were included in the band's 2013 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.</p><p>Heart rose to fame with music influenced by hard rock and heavy metal, as well as folk music.

For most of their career, the group consisted of Stephen Malkmus (vocals and guitar), Scott Kannberg (guitar and vocals), Mark Ibold (bass), Steve West (drums) and Bob Nastanovich (percussion and vocals). Initially conceived as a recording project, the band at first avoided press or live performances, while attracting considerable underground attention with their early releases. Gradually evolving into a more polished band, Pavement recorded five full-length albums and ten EPs over the course of their decade-long career, though they disbanded with some acrimony in 1999 as the members moved on to other projects. In 2010, they undertook a well-received reunion tour, with another international tour currently ongoing in 2022 and 2023.</p><p>Though only briefly attracting mainstream attention with the single ""Cut Your Hair"" in 1994, Pavement was a successful indie rock band. Rather than signing with a major label as many of their 1980s forebears had done, they remained signed to independent labels throughout their career, including Flying Nun and Matador. They have often been described as one of the most influential bands to emerge from the American underground in the '90s. Some prominent music critics, such as Robert Christgau and Stephen Thomas Erlewine, called them the best band of the 1990s. They have achieved a cult following.</p>

</p>

<p><b>Enigma</b> is a German musical project founded in 1990 by Romanian-German musician and producer Michael Cretu. Cretu had released several solo records, collaborated with various artists, and produced albums for his then-wife, German pop singer Sandra, before he conceived the idea of a new-age, worldbeat project. He recorded the first Enigma studio album, <i>MCMXC a.D.</i> (1990), with contributions from David Fairstein and Frank Peterson. The album remains Enigma's most successful, helped by the international hit single ""Sadeness (Part I)"", which sold twelve million units alone. According to Cretu, the inspiration for the creation of the project came from his desire to make a kind of music that did not obey ""the old rules and habits"" and presented a new form of artistic expression with mystic and experimental components.</p><p>Enigma followed <i>MCMXC a.D.</i> with a series of albums that involved several musicians and producers working with Cretu. The first was <i>The Cross of Changes</i> (1993), which incorporated tribal and ethnic influences and sold over eight million copies worldwide, followed by <i>Le Roi Est Mort, Vive Le Roi!</i> (1996), which blended the Gregorian chants reminiscent of the first album with the strong intercultural soundscapes present in the second. Enigma's fourth album <i>The Screen Behind the Mirror</i> (2000) started a slight departure from the previous world music themes towards a heavier electronic atmosphere. This evolution culminated with <i>Voyageur</i> (2003), its fifth and more pop-based album, and <i>A Posteriori</i> (2006), a work inspired by the future collision between the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies, with distinct operatic tones and an electronic spectrum closer to <i>Voyageur</i> than the earlier releases. <i>Seven Lives Many Faces</i> (2008) followed and contained a mixture of classical and modern elements ranging from ethnic chants to rap and dubstep influences. Its eighth album, <i>The Fall of a Rebel Angel</i>, was released in November 2016.</p><p>Enigma has sold over 8.5 million RIAA-certified albums in the US and an estimated 70 million worldwide with over 100 gold and platinum certifications.

<p><b>Jane's Addiction</b> is an American rock band from Los Angeles, formed in 1985. The band consists of vocalist Perry Farrell, guitarist Dave Navarro, drummer Stephen Perkins and bassist Eric Avery. Jane's Addiction was one of the first bands from the early 1990s alternative rock movement to gain both mainstream media attention and commercial success in the United States. 
</p><p>Founded by Farrell and Avery, following the disintegration of Farrell's previous band Psi Com, Jane's Addiction's first release was a self-titled live album, <i>Jane's Addiction</i> (1987), which caught the attention of Warner Bros. Records. The band's first two studio albums, <i>Nothing's Shocking</i> (1988) and <i>Ritual de lo Habitual</i> (1990), were released to widespread critical acclaim, and an increasing cult fanbase. As a result, Jane's Addiction became icons of what Farrell dubbed the ""Alternative Nation"". The band's initial farewell tour, in 1991, launched the first Lollapalooza, which has since become a perennial alternative rock festival.
</p><p>In 1997, the band reunited with Flea of the Red Hot Chili Peppers replacing Avery on bass guitar for a one-off tour. In 2001, a second reunion took place, with Martyn LeNoble—and later Chris Chaney—occupying the role of bass guitarist. In 2003, the band released its third studio album, <i>Strays</i>, before dissolving again the following year. In 2008, the band's original line-up reunited and embarked on a world tour. Avery acrimoniously left the band in early 2010, as the group began working on new material. In 2011, the band released its fourth studio album, <i>The Great Escape Artist</i>, with Chaney returning to the band for its recording and subsequent tour.
</p><p>Between the years of 2012 and 2022, the band remained active with occasional tours and performances honouring their legacy. In August 2022, Avery rejoined the band after a twelve-year absence, ahead of a joint tour with the Smashing Pumpkins.

He has won multiple awards in his career, including a Grammy Award in 2020, and has twice been nominated for the Brit Award for Best British Male Artist. In 2003, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2004, <i>Rolling Stone</i> ranked Costello number 80 on its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.</p><p>Costello began his career as part of London's pub rock scene in the early 1970s and later became associated with the first wave of the British punk and new wave movement that emerged in the mid-to-late 1970s. His critically acclaimed debut album <i>My Aim Is True</i> was released in 1977. Shortly after recording it, he formed the Attractions as his backing band. His second album <i>This Year's Model</i> was released in 1978, and was ranked number 11 by <i>Rolling Stone</i> on its list of the best albums from 1967 to 1987. His third album <i>Armed Forces</i> was released in 1979, and features his highest-charting single, ""Oliver's Army"" (number 2 in the UK). His first three albums all appeared on <i>Rolling Stone</i><span>'</span>s list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time in 2003.
</p><p>Costello and the Attractions toured and recorded together for the better part of a decade, though differences between them caused a split by 1986. Much of Costello's work since has been as a solo artist, though reunions with members of the Attractions have been credited to the group over the years. Costello's lyrics employ a wide vocabulary and frequent wordplay. His music has drawn on many diverse genres; one critic described him as a ""pop encyclopaedia"", able to ""reinvent the past in his own image"".  Since 2002, his touring band (featuring a rotating cast of musicians) has been known as the Imposters.
</p><p>Costello has co-written several original songs for films, including ""God Give Me Strength"" from <i>Grace of My Heart</i> (1996, with Burt Bacharach) and ""The Scarlet Tide"" from <i>Cold Mountain</i> (2003, with T-Bone Burnett). For the latter, Elvis was nominated (along with Burnett) for the Academy Award for Best Original Song and the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media.

</p>

<p><b>Thin Lizzy</b> are an Irish hard rock band formed in Dublin in 1969. Their music reflects a wide range of influences, including blues, soul music, psychedelic rock and traditional Irish folk music, but is generally classified as hard rock or sometimes heavy metal.
</p><p>Two of the founding members, drummer Brian Downey and bass guitarist, lead vocalist and principal songwriter Phil Lynott, met while still in school. Lynott led the group throughout their recording career of twelve studio albums, writing most of the material. The singles ""Whiskey in the Jar"" (a traditional Irish ballad), ""The Boys Are Back in Town"" and ""Waiting for an Alibi"" were international hits. After Lynott's death in 1986, various incarnations of the band emerged over the years based initially around guitarists Scott Gorham and John Sykes, though Sykes left the band in 2009. Gorham later continued with a new line-up including Downey. In 2012, Gorham and Downey decided against recording new material as Thin Lizzy so a new band, Black Star Riders, was formed to tour and produce new releases, such as their debut album <i>All Hell Breaks Loose</i>. Thin Lizzy have since reunited for occasional concerts.</p><p>Lynott, Thin Lizzy's <i>de facto</i> leader, was composer or co-composer of almost all of the band's songs, and the first Black Irishman to achieve commercial success in the field of rock music. Thin Lizzy featured several guitarists throughout their history, with Downey and Lynott as the rhythm section, on the drums and bass guitar. As well as being multiracial, the band drew their early members not only from both sides of the Irish border but also from both the Catholic and Protestant communities during The Troubles.
</p><p><i>Rolling Stone</i> magazine describes the band as distinctly hard rock, ""far apart from the braying mid-70s metal pack"". AllMusic critic John Dougan has written that ""As the band's creative force, Lynott was a more insightful and intelligent writer than many of his ilk, preferring slice-of-life working-class dramas of love and hate influenced by Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen and virtually all of the Irish literary tradition.""</p>",

<p><b>(Achille) Claude Debussy</b> (<small>French: </small><span title=""Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)"" lang=""fr-Latn-fonipa"">[aʃil klod dəbysi]</span>; 22 August 1862 – 25 March 1918) was a French composer. He is sometimes seen as the first Impressionist composer, although he vigorously rejected the term. He was among the most influential composers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
</p><p>Born to a family of modest means and little cultural involvement, Debussy showed enough musical talent to be admitted at the age of ten to France's leading music college, the Conservatoire de Paris. He originally studied the piano, but found his vocation in innovative composition, despite the disapproval of the Conservatoire's conservative professors. He took many years to develop his mature style, and was nearly 40 when he achieved international fame in 1902 with the only opera he completed, <i>Pelléas et Mélisande</i>.
</p><p>Debussy's orchestral works include <i>Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune</i> (1894), <i>Nocturnes</i> (1897–1899) and <i>Images</i> (1905–1912). His music was to a considerable extent a reaction against Wagner and the German musical tradition. He regarded the classical symphony as obsolete and sought an alternative in his ""symphonic sketches"", <i>La mer</i> (1903–1905). His piano works include sets of 24 Préludes and 12 Études. Throughout his career he wrote <i>mélodies</i> based on a wide variety of poetry, including his own. He was greatly influenced by the Symbolist poetic movement of the later 19th century. A small number of works, including the early <i>La Damoiselle élue</i> and the late <i>Le Martyre de saint Sébastien</i> have important parts for chorus. In his final years, he focused on chamber music, completing three of six planned sonatas for different combinations of instruments.
</p><p>With early influences including Russian and Far Eastern music, Debussy developed his own style of harmony and orchestral colouring, derided – and unsuccessfully resisted – by much of the musical establishment of the day. His works have strongly influenced a wide range of composers including Béla Bartók, Olivier Messiaen, George Benjamin, and the jazz pianist and composer Bill Evans. Debussy died from cancer at his home in Paris at the age of 55 after a composing career of a little more than 30 years.

Former members of the band include drummers Victor DeLorenzo (1980–1993, 2002–2013), Guy Hoffman (1993–2002), and Brian Viglione (2013–2016).

<p><b>The Isley Brothers</b> (<span></span> <i title=""English pronunciation respelling""><span>EYEZ</span>-lee</i>) are an American musical group originally from Cincinnati, Ohio, that began as a vocal trio consisting of brothers O'Kelly ""Kelly"" Isley Jr., Rudolph Isley and Ronald Isley in the 1950s. With a career spanning over seven decades, the group has enjoyed one of the ""longest, most influential, and most diverse careers in the pantheon of popular music"".</p><p>Together with a fourth brother, Vernon, the group performed gospel music until Vernon's death a few years after its formation. After moving to New York City in the late 1950s, the group had their first successes during these early years, and rose to prominence in 1959 with their fourth single, ""Shout"", written by the three brothers, which became their first single to chart on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100, and sold over a million copies. In the 1960s, the group recorded songs for a variety of labels, including the top 20 single ""Twist and Shout"" and the Motown single ""This Old Heart of Mine (Is Weak for You)"", before recording and releasing the Grammy Award-winning hit ""It's Your Thing"" on their own label, T-Neck Records.
</p><p>The inclusion of younger brothers Ernie Isley (lead guitar, drums) and Marvin Isley (bass guitar), and Rudolph's brother-in-law Chris Jasper (keyboards, synthesizers), in 1973 turned the original vocal trio into a complete band and led to the group’s reaching the height of their success. For the next full decade, they recorded a string of top-selling albums including <i>3 + 3</i>, <i>Between the Sheets</i>, and <i>The Heat Is On</i>, with the latter peaking at number one on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 chart. The six-member band splintered in 1983, with Ernie, Marvin, and Chris Jasper forming the short-lived spinoff group Isley-Jasper-Isley. The oldest member, O'Kelly, died in 1986. Afterwards Rudolph and Ronald released a pair of albums as a duo before Rudolph retired to a life in the Christian ministry in 1989. After multiple lineup changes, the remaining duo of Ronald and Ernie achieved mainstream success with the albums <i>Mission to Please</i> (1996), <i>Eternal</i> (2001) and <i>Body Kiss</i> (2003). <i>Eternal</i> spawned the top 20 hit ""Contagious"". As of 2021, the Isley Brothers continue to perform under the lineup of Ronald and Ernie.
</p><p>The Isley Brothers have sold over 18 million units in the United States alone. With their first major hit charting in 1959 (""Shout""), and their last one in 2001 (""Contagious""), they are among the few groups ever to have hit the Billboard Hot 100 with new music in six different decades. Sixteen of their albums charted in the Top 40 and thirteen of those albums have been certified gold, platinum or multi-platinum by the RIAA. The brothers have been honored by several musical institutions, including the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, which inducted them in 1992. Five years later, they were added to Hollywood's Rockwalk, and in 2003 they were inducted to the Vocal Group Hall of Fame. They received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2014.</p>

<p>The <b>Grateful Dead</b> was an American rock band formed in 1965 in Palo Alto, California. The band is known for its eclectic style, which fused elements of rock, folk, country, jazz, bluegrass, blues, rock and roll, gospel, reggae, world music, and psychedelia; for live performances of lengthy instrumental jams that typically incorporated modal and tonal improvisation; and for its devoted fan base, known as ""Deadheads"". According to Lenny Kaye, ""their music touches on ground that most other groups don't even know exists."" These various influences were distilled into a diverse and psychedelic whole that made the Grateful Dead ""the pioneering Godfathers of the jam band world"".</p><p>The band was ranked 57th by <i>Rolling Stone</i> magazine in its ""The Greatest Artists of All Time"" issue. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and a recording of their May 8, 1977 performance at Cornell University's Barton Hall was added to the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress in 2012. Despite having only one top-40 single in their 30-year career, ""Touch of Grey"", the Grateful Dead remained among the highest-grossing American touring acts for multiple decades and gained a committed fanbase by word of mouth and the exchange of live recordings due to the band's permissive stance on taping.
</p><p>The Grateful Dead was founded in the San Francisco Bay Area amid the rise of the counterculture of the 1960s. The founding members were Jerry Garcia (lead guitar, vocals), Bob Weir (rhythm guitar, vocals), Ron ""Pigpen"" McKernan (keyboards, harmonica, vocals), Phil Lesh (bass, vocals), and Bill Kreutzmann (drums). Members of the Grateful Dead, originally known as the Warlocks, had played together in various Bay Area ensembles, including the traditional jug band Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions. Lesh was the last member to join the Warlocks before they changed their name to the Grateful Dead; replacing Dana Morgan Jr., who had played bass for a few gigs. Drummer Mickey Hart and non-performing lyricist Robert Hunter joined in 1967. With the exception of McKernan, who died in 1973, and Hart, who took time off from 1971 to 1974, the core of the band stayed together for its entire 30-year history. The other official members of the band are Tom Constanten (keyboards; 1968–1970), John Perry Barlow (non-performing lyricist; 1971–1995), Keith Godchaux (keyboards, occasional vocals; 1971–1979), Donna Godchaux (vocals; 1972–1979), Brent Mydland (keyboards, vocals; 1979–1990), and Vince Welnick (keyboards, vocals; 1990–1995). Bruce Hornsby (accordion, piano, vocals) was a touring member from 1990 to 1992, as well as a guest with the band on occasion before and after the tours.
</p><p>After the death of Garcia in 1995, former members of the band, along with other musicians, toured as the Other Ones in 1998, 2000, and 2002, and the Dead in 2003, 2004, and 2009. In 2015, the four surviving core members marked the band's 50th anniversary in a series of concerts that were billed as their last performances together. There have also been several spin-offs featuring one or more core members, such as Dead &amp; Company, Furthur, the Rhythm Devils, Phil Lesh and Friends, RatDog, and Billy &amp; the Kids.

<p><b>Franz Peter Schubert</b> (<small>German: </small><span title=""Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)"" lang=""de-Latn-fonipa"">[ˈfʁant͡s ˈpeːtɐ ˈʃuːbɐt]</span>; 31 January 1797 – 19 November 1828) was an Austrian composer of the late Classical and early Romantic eras. Despite his short lifetime, Schubert left behind a vast <i>oeuvre</i>, including more than 600 secular vocal works (mainly lieder), seven complete symphonies, sacred music, operas, incidental music, and a large body of piano and chamber music. His major works include ""Erlkönig"" (D. 328), the Piano Quintet in A major, D. 667 (<i>Trout Quintet</i>), the Symphony No. 8 in B minor, D. 759 (<i>Unfinished Symphony</i>), the ""Great"" Symphony No. 9 in C major, D. 944, the String Quintet (D. 956), the three last piano sonatas (D. 958–960), the opera <i>Fierrabras</i> (D. 796), the incidental music to the play <i>Rosamunde</i> (D. 797), and the song cycles <i>Die schöne Müllerin</i> (D. 795) and <i>Winterreise</i> (D. 911).
</p><p>Born in the Himmelpfortgrund suburb of Vienna, Schubert showed uncommon gifts for music from an early age. His father gave him his first violin lessons and his elder brother gave him piano lessons, but Schubert soon exceeded their abilities. In 1808, at the age of eleven, he became a pupil at the Stadtkonvikt school, where he became acquainted with the orchestral music of Joseph Haydn, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and Ludwig van Beethoven. He left the Stadtkonvikt at the end of 1813, and returned home to live with his father, where he began studying to become a schoolteacher. Despite this, he continued his studies in composition with Antonio Salieri and still composed prolifically. In 1821, Schubert was admitted to the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde as a performing member, which helped establish his name among the Viennese citizenry. He gave a concert of his own works to critical acclaim in March 1828, the only time he did so in his career. He died eight months later at the age of 31, the cause officially attributed to typhoid fever, but believed by some historians to be syphilis.
</p><p>Appreciation of Schubert's music while he was alive was limited to a relatively small circle of admirers in Vienna, but interest in his work increased greatly in the decades following his death. Felix Mendelssohn, Robert Schumann, Franz Liszt, Johannes Brahms and other 19th-century composers discovered and championed his works. Today, Schubert is ranked among the greatest composers in the history of Western music and his work continues to be admired and performed.

During this time period, they released several EPs and singles, and with Only's brother Doyle as guitarist, the albums <i>Walk Among Us</i> (1982) and <i>Earth A.D./Wolfs Blood</i> (1983), both considered to have significance to the early-1980s hardcore punk movement. The band has gone through many lineup changes over the years, with bassist Jerry Only being the only constant member in the group.
</p><p>The Misfits disbanded in 1983, and Glenn Danzig went on to form Samhain and then Danzig. Several albums of reissued and previously unreleased material were issued after the group's dissolution, and their music later became influential to punk rock, heavy metal, hard rock, and alternative rock, including high-profile acts such as Metallica, Guns N' Roses, Marilyn Manson, Green Day, the Offspring, NOFX, AFI and My Chemical Romance. After a series of legal battles with Danzig, Only and Doyle regained the rights to record and perform as the Misfits. They formed a new version of the band in 1995 with singer Michale Graves and drummer Dr. Chud. This incarnation of Misfits had more of a heavy metal sound, and released the albums <i>American Psycho</i> (1997) and <i>Famous Monsters</i> (1999) before dissolving in 2000. Jerry Only then took over lead vocals and recruited former Black Flag guitarist Dez Cadena and former Ramones drummer Marky Ramone for a Misfits 25th anniversary tour.
</p><p>This lineup released an album of cover songs titled <i>Project 1950</i> and toured for several years. In 2005, Marky was replaced by Robo, who had played with Black Flag in the early 1980s and had also previously been Misfits' drummer from 1982 to 1983. This lineup released a single titled ""Land of the Dead"" in 2009. The Misfits' lineup of Only, Cadena, and drummer Eric ""Chupacabra"" Arce released a new album titled <i>The Devil's Rain</i> in October 2011. In 2015, it was announced that Cadena would be taking a break from music after receiving a cancer diagnosis, and was replaced by Only's son Jerry Caiafa II, presented as Jerry Other. That same year Soulfly's Marc Rizzo joined the band, also playing guitar. He filled in for Cadena, before Caiafa would become the sole guitarist for the band.
</p><p>In September 2016, for the first time in 33 years, Danzig, Only, and Doyle reunited for two headlining shows as the Original Misfits at that year's edition of Riot Fest, along with drummer Dave Lombardo and second guitarist Acey Slade. The Original Misfits lineup continued performing sporadically through the present.

Machine Head,Oakland,1991–present,Machine Head (band),"<p class=""mw-empty-elt"">
</p>
<p><b>Machine Head</b> is an American heavy metal band from Oakland, California. The band was formed in 1991 by vocalist/rhythm guitarist Robb Flynn, who remains the only original member of the band. Machine Head's aggressive musicianship made it one of the pioneering bands in the new wave of American heavy metal. Its current lineup comprises Flynn, bassist Jared MacEachern, lead guitarist Wacław Kiełtyka and drummer Matt Alston. Bassist Adam Duce, lead guitarists Logan Mader, Ahrue Luster and Phil Demmel, and drummers Tony Costanza, Chris Kontos and Dave McClain are former members of the band; Mader and Kontos toured with the band in 2019 and 2020 as part of the 25th anniversary tour for its first album, <i>Burn My Eyes</i> (1994).
</p><p>Machine Head's first four albums earned the band a growing fan base in Europe, however the band would not have success in the United States until later releases. The band drew controversy with its fourth album, <i>Supercharger</i> (2001), which was released three weeks after the September 11 attacks; its only single, ""Crashing Around You"", and its music video (which featured burning buildings) was pulled from all media outlets. The band nearly disbanded in 2002 after negotiating off its label Roadrunner Records as a result of the controversy, however the band would eventually re-sign with the label.
</p><p>Having experimented with elements of groove metal and nu metal in its early releases, Machine Head changed to a more traditional thrash metal sound and longer songs with its sixth album, <i>The Blackening</i> (2007), which drew critical acclaim and was chosen as Album of the Decade by <i>Metal Hammer</i> in 2010; the album's first single, ""Aesthetics of Hate"", also earned the band a Grammy Award nomination. The band achieved similar success with its following two albums, <i>Unto the Locust</i> (2011) and <i>Bloodstone &amp; Diamonds</i> (2014), before once again experimenting with nu metal on the band's ninth album, <i>Catharsis</i> (2018). After <i>Catharsis</i>, Machine Head reverted back to their groove and thrash metal roots with their tenth album, <i>Of Kingdom and Crown</i> (2022), which doubles as their first concept album.
</p><p>Machine Head has released ten studio albums, two live albums, one video album, 13 singles and 15 music videos. Four of the band's studio albums have been certified silver in the United Kingdom, and the band's highest peak on the <i>Billboard</i> 200 came with <i>Bloodstone &amp; Diamonds</i> at number 21. As of 2013, the band has sold over three million records worldwide.</p>

</p>
<p><b>Public Enemy</b> is an American hip hop group formed by Chuck D and Flavor Flav on Long Island, New York, in 1985. The group rose to prominence for their political messages including subjects such as American racism and the American media. Their debut album, <i>Yo! Bum Rush the Show</i>, was released in 1987 to critical acclaim, and their second album, <i>It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back</i> (1988), was the first hip hop album to top <i>The Village Voice</i><span>'</span>s Pazz &amp; Jop critics' poll. Their next three albums, <i>Fear of a Black Planet</i> (1990), <i>Apocalypse 91... The Enemy Strikes Black</i> (1991) and <i>Muse Sick-n-Hour Mess Age</i> (1994), were also well received. The group has since released twelve more studio albums, including the soundtrack to the 1998 sports-drama film <i>He Got Game</i> and a collaborative album with Paris, <i>Rebirth of a Nation</i> (2006).
</p><p>Public Enemy has gone through many lineup changes over the years, with Chuck D and Flavor Flav remaining the only constant members. Co-founder Professor Griff left in 1989 but rejoined in 1998, before parting ways again some years later. DJ Lord also joined Public Enemy in 1998 as the replacement of the group's original DJ Terminator X. In 2020, it was announced that Flavor Flav had been fired from the group. His firing was later revealed to be a publicity stunt that was called an April Fools' Day prank. Public Enemy, without Flavor Flav, would also tour and record music under the name of Public Enemy Radio which consists of the lineup of Chuck D, Jahi, DJ Lord and the S1Ws.
</p><p>Public Enemy's first four albums during the late 1980s and early 1990s were all certified either gold or platinum and were, according to music critic Robert Hilburn in 1998, ""the most acclaimed body of work ever by a hip hop act"". Critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine called them ""the most influential and radical band of their time"". They were inducted into Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2013. They were honored with the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at the 62nd Grammy Awards.

The band's second studio album, <i>One Way Ticket to Hell... and Back</i>, was released in November 2005. The following year, Justin Hawkins departed from the band after successfully completing a course of rehabilitation from alcohol and cocaine abuse.

Its core line-up was led by singer-songwriter, record producer, and multi-instrumentalist Sly Stone, and included Stone's brother and singer/guitarist Freddie Stone, sister and singer/keyboardist Rose Stone, trumpeter Cynthia Robinson, drummer Greg Errico, saxophonist Jerry Martini, and bassist Larry Graham. It was the first major American rock group to have a racially integrated, male and female lineup.</p><p>Formed in 1966, the group's music synthesized a variety of disparate musical genres to help pioneer the emerging ""psychedelic soul"" sound. They released a series of Top 10 <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 hits such as ""Dance to the Music"" (1968), ""Everyday People"" (1968), and ""Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)"" (1969), as well as critically acclaimed albums such as <i>Stand!</i> (1969), which combined pop sensibility with social commentary. In the 1970s, it transitioned into a darker and less commercial funk sound on releases such as <i>There's a Riot Goin' On</i> (1971) and <i>Fresh</i> (1973), proving as influential as their early work. By 1975, drug problems and interpersonal clashes led to dissolution, though Sly continued to record and tour with a new rotating lineup under the name ""Sly and the Family Stone"" until drug problems forced his effective retirement in 1987.</p><p>The work of Sly and the Family Stone greatly influenced the sound of subsequent American funk, pop, soul, R&amp;B, and hip hop music. Music critic Joel Selvin wrote, ""there are two types of black music: black music before Sly Stone, and black music after Sly Stone"". In 2010, they were ranked 43rd in Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time, and three of their albums are included on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.

</p>
<p><b>Rainbow</b> (also known as <b>Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow</b> or <b>Blackmore's Rainbow</b>) are  a British rock supergroup, formed in London and Los Angeles in 1975 by guitarist Ritchie Blackmore. Established in the aftermath of Blackmore's first departure from Deep Purple, they originally featured four members of the band Elf, including their singer Ronnie James Dio, but after their self-titled debut album, Blackmore fired these members, except Dio, recruiting drummer Cozy Powell, bassist Jimmy Bain and keyboardist Tony Carey. This line-up recorded the band's second album <i>Rising</i> (1976), while <i>Long Live Rock 'n' Roll</i> (1978) saw Bob Daisley and David Stone replace Bain and Carey, respectively. This was the last album with Dio before he left the band to join Black Sabbath in 1979.
</p><p>Rainbow's early work primarily featured mystical lyrics with a neoclassical metal style, then went in a more pop-rock oriented direction following Dio's departure from the group. In 1979, Blackmore and Powell revamped the group, recruiting three new members —singer Graham Bonnet, keyboardist Don Airey and another then-former Deep Purple member, bassist Roger Glover—and this line-up gave the band their commercial breakthrough with the single ""Since You Been Gone"" from their fourth studio album <i>Down to Earth</i>. With Joe Lynn Turner, who replaced Bonnet in 1980, with Powell departing at the same time, Rainbow recorded three more albums—<i>Difficult to Cure</i> (1981), <i>Straight Between the Eyes</i> (1982) and <i>Bent Out of Shape</i> (1983)—that had commercial success similar to the band's previous albums. Other members of the band during this period were drummers Bobby Rondinelli and Chuck Burgi, and keyboardist David Rosenthal. The band split in 1984, when Blackmore and Glover re-joined Deep Purple for their reunion. In 1993, after leaving Deep Purple for a second time, Blackmore reformed Rainbow with a new line-up, fronted by a then-unknown Doogie White, which recorded their eighth and last studio album to date <i>Stranger in Us All</i> (1995). Blackmore's change in direction, from rock to Renaissance and medieval-influenced music, led to Rainbow's second dissolution in 1997. He revived the band once again in 2015, and they performed live occasionally within the next few years.
</p><p>Over the years Rainbow went through many personnel changes, with each studio album recorded with a different line-up, leaving Blackmore as the band's only constant member. In addition to Blackmore, Rainbow's current line-up includes Ronnie Romero on vocals, Jens Johansson on keyboards, Bob Nouveau on bass and David Keith on drums.
</p><p>Rainbow were ranked No. 90 on VH1's <i>100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock</i>. The band have sold over 28 million records worldwide.</p>",

It was also in 1975 when America released <i>History: America's Greatest Hits</i>, a compilation of hit singles, which was certified multi-platinum in the United States and Australia.

</p>
<p><b>The Monkees</b> were an American pop rock band, formed in Los Angeles in 1966, whose lineup consisted of the American actors/musicians Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith and Peter Tork alongside English actor/singer Davy Jones. The group was conceived in 1965 by television producers Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider for the situation comedy series of the same name. Music credited to the band was released on LP, as well as being included in the show, which aired from 1966 to 1968.
</p><p>While the sitcom was a mostly straightforward affair, the music production generated tension and controversy almost from the beginning. Music supervisor Don Kirshner was dissatisfied with the quartet's musical abilities, and he limited their involvement during the recording process, relying instead on professional songwriters and studio musicians. This arrangement yielded multiple hit albums and singles, but it did not sit well with the band members, who were facing a public backlash for not playing on the recordings. After a brief power struggle, the band members gained full control over the recording process. For two albums, the Monkees mostly performed as a group, but, within a year, each member was pursuing his own interests under the Monkees name. By the end of 1968, they were once again a group in name only, the show had been canceled, and their motion picture, <i>Head</i>, had flopped. Tork left the band soon after, followed by Nesmith a year later, and the Monkees officially broke up in 1970.
</p><p>A revival of interest in the television show came in 1986, leading to a series of official reunion tours, a television special, and four new full-length records, all of which spanned the next 35 years, though these efforts rarely featured all four members performing together. With Jones' death in 2012 and Tork's in 2019, Dolenz and Nesmith were left to embark on a farewell tour in 2021, finishing shortly before Nesmith's death at the end of the year.
</p><p>Spurred by the success of the show, the Monkees were one of the most successful bands of the 1960s. The band sold more than 75 million records worldwide making them one of the biggest-selling groups of all time with international hits, including ""Last Train to Clarksville"", ""I'm a Believer"", ""A Little Bit Me, a Little Bit You"", ""Pleasant Valley Sunday"", and ""Daydream Believer"", four chart-topping albums and three chart-topping songs (""Last Train to Clarksville"", ""I'm a Believer"", and ""Daydream Believer""). Newspapers and magazines falsely reported that the Monkees outsold the Beatles and the Rolling Stones combined in 1967, a claim that originated from Nesmith in a 1977 interview.</p>",

<p><b>The Carpenters</b> (officially known as <b>Carpenters</b>) were an American vocal and instrumental duo consisting of siblings Karen (1950–1983) and Richard Carpenter (born 1946). They produced a distinct, soft, musical style, combining Karen's contralto vocals with Richard's harmonizing, arranging, and composition skills. During their 14-year career, the Carpenters recorded 10 albums along with numerous singles and several television specials.
</p><p>The siblings were born in New Haven, Connecticut, and moved to Downey, California, in 1963. Richard took piano lessons as a child, progressing to California State University, Long Beach, while Karen learned the drums. They first performed together as a duo in 1965 and formed the jazz-oriented Richard Carpenter Trio followed by the middle-of-the-road group Spectrum. Signing as Carpenters to A&amp;M Records in 1969, they achieved major success the following year with the hit singles ""(They Long to Be) Close to You"" and ""We've Only Just Begun"". The duo's brand of melodic pop produced a record-breaking run of hit recordings on the American Top 40 and Adult Contemporary charts, and they became leading sellers in the soft rock, easy listening, and adult contemporary music genres. They had three number-one singles and five number-two singles on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 and 15 number-one hits on the Adult Contemporary chart, in addition to 12 top-10 singles.

Their joint career ended in 1983 when Karen died from heart failure brought on by complications of anorexia. Extensive news coverage surrounding these circumstances increased public awareness of eating disorders. Their music continues to attract critical acclaim and commercial success. They have sold more than 100 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling music artists of all time.

They have written for and starred in the American TV program <i>Saturday Night Live</i> (<i>SNL</i>).
</p><p>The three first met in junior high. After graduating from college, they regrouped and moved to Los Angeles, where they struggled to find work and began making short films, combining absurdist comedy and occasionally music. Among the first performers to post their material on the Internet, they involved themselves with Channel 101, a non-profit monthly short film festival. Their popularity at the screenings led to unsuccessful pilot deals with Fox and Comedy Central and a writing job for the 2005 MTV Movie Awards. Subsequently, that show's host, Jimmy Fallon, recommended them to Lorne Michaels, the creator of <i>Saturday Night Live</i>.
</p><p>The group was hired for <i>SNL</i> in 2005, with all three as writers and Samberg as a featured player. Bypassing the traditional process of pitching, they recorded their own material independently and submitted it to the program. Their second sketch to air, ""Lazy Sunday"", became an internet sensation, the first of many viral videos they produced while at <i>SNL</i>. They led their own division at the program — <i>SNL</i> Digital Shorts — which led to numerous viral videos, including ""Motherlover"", ""Dick in a Box"", ""Jizz in My Pants"", ""I'm on a Boat"", ""Like a Boss"", ""I Just Had Sex"", ""Jack Sparrow"", and ""YOLO"". Their musical comedic work has comprised four full studio albums: <i>Incredibad</i> (2009), <i>Turtleneck &amp; Chain</i> (2011), <i>The Wack Album</i> (2013), and <i>The Unauthorized Bash Brothers Experience</i> (2019), along with a soundtrack album for their 2016 film <i>Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping</i>.

</p><p>Founded by Cox and Archuleta, Deerhunter's first stable line-up included guitarist Colin Mee and bass guitarist Justin Bosworth. After recording a split EP with Alphabets, Bosworth died on March 29, 2004, of head injuries suffered during a skateboarding accident. He was 23 years old. The band recorded their first studio album, <i>Turn It Up Faggot</i> (2005), with Josh Fauver occupying the vacant role of bass guitarist. Following the album's release, Cox asked childhood friend, Lockett Pundt, to join Deerhunter as a song-writing partner, second guitarist, and occasional lead vocalist.
</p><p>Recorded in two days, the band's follow-up, <i>Cryptograms</i> (2007), combined ambient work and more angular garage rock songs. The release was quickly followed by the EP, <i>Fluorescent Grey</i>. While touring the releases, Mee departed from Deerhunter, due to disagreements over the band's schedule, but rejoined soon after. Deerhunter released two studio albums, <i>Microcastle</i> and <i>Weird Era Cont.</i>, in 2008. Both albums were recorded without the participation of Mee, who again departed for a second and final time. The band enlisted former cheerleader and high school friend of Cox, Whitney Petty, as his touring replacement.
</p><p>Recorded as a four-piece with producer Ben H. Allen and engineer David Barbe the band's fourth studio album, <i>Halcyon Digest</i> (2010), was released to widespread critical acclaim, ranked as Pitchfork's 29th and Stereogum's 78th best album of the decade. In 2012, the departure of long-time bassist Fauver placed the band's future in doubt. Cox, Pundt and Archuleta regrouped with new members, bassist Josh McKay and guitarist Frankie Broyles, to record the primitivist garage rock and musique concrète-influenced <i>Monomania</i> (2013). The album expanded on a darker and more disturbing sound, complete with treated tape recordings of rats and insects, exploring themes of disassociation and mental illness.
</p><p>The following year, Cox was struck by a vehicle while walking his dog near his home in Atlanta's Grant Park. During his recovery and rehabilitation he focused on writing songs resulting in the album <i>Fading Frontier</i> (2015).
</p><p>Deerhunter have described themselves as ""ambient punk,"" though they incorporate a wide range of genres, including noise, garage rock, art rock, as well as significant pop elements.

In preparation for touring, the trio added Stills' former Buffalo Springfield bandmate Neil Young as a full member, along with touring members Dallas Taylor (drums) and Greg Reeves (bass). The band, performing as Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young, played the Woodstock festival that August. 
</p><p>The band's first album with Young, <i>Déjà Vu</i>, reached number one on several international charts in 1970, and remains their best-selling album, going on to sell over eight million copies with three hit singles: ""Woodstock"", ""Teach Your Children"", and ""Our House"". The group's second tour, which produced the live double album <i>4 Way Street</i> (1971), was fraught with arguments between Young and Taylor, which resulted in Taylor being replaced by John Barbata, and tensions with Stills, which resulted in his being temporarily dismissed from the band. At the end of the tour they disbanded. The group later reunited several times, sometimes with Young, and released eight studio and four live albums.
</p><p>Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and all three members were also inducted for their work in other groups: Crosby for the Byrds; Stills for Buffalo Springfield; and Nash for the Hollies. Neil Young has also been inducted as a solo artist and as a member of Buffalo Springfield but not as a member of CSN. Their final studio album was 1999's <i>Looking Forward</i>, and they remained a performing act until 2015. Crosby died in 2023, ruling out any further full reunions of either lineup.

Johannes Brahms,,,Johannes Brahms,"<p class=""mw-empty-elt"">


</p>

<p><b>Johannes Brahms</b> (<small>German: </small><span title=""Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)"" lang=""de-Latn-fonipa"">[joˈhanəs ˈbʁaːms]</span>; 7 May 1833 – 3 April 1897) was a German composer, pianist, and conductor of the mid-Romantic period. Born in Hamburg into a Lutheran family, he spent much of his professional life in Vienna. He is sometimes grouped with Johann Sebastian Bach and Ludwig van Beethoven as one of the ""Three Bs"" of music, a comment originally made by the nineteenth-century conductor Hans von Bülow.
</p><p>Brahms composed for symphony orchestra, chamber ensembles, piano, organ, violin, voice, and chorus. A virtuoso pianist, he premiered many of his own works. He worked with leading performers of his time, including the pianist Clara Schumann and the violinist Joseph Joachim (the three were close friends). Many of his works have become staples of the modern concert repertoire.
</p><p>Brahms has been considered both a traditionalist and an innovator, by his contemporaries and by later writers. His music is rooted in the structures and compositional techniques of the Classical masters. Embedded within those structures are deeply romantic motifs. While some contemporaries found his music to be overly academic, his contribution and craftsmanship were admired by subsequent figures as diverse as Arnold Schoenberg and Edward Elgar. The detailed construction of Brahms's works was a starting point and an inspiration for a generation of composers.

</p>
<p><b>Roxy Music</b> are an English rock band formed in 1970 by Bryan Ferry—who became the band's lead vocalist and principal songwriter—and bassist Graham Simpson. The other longtime members are Phil Manzanera (guitar), Andy Mackay (saxophone and oboe), and Paul Thompson (drums and percussion). Other members included Brian Eno (synthesizer and ""treatments"") and Eddie Jobson (synthesizer and violin). Although the band took a break from group activities in 1976 and again in 1983, they reunited for a concert tour in 2001, and have toured together intermittently since. Ferry frequently enlisted band members as session musicians for his solo releases.
</p><p>Roxy Music became a successful act in Europe and Australia during the 1970s. This success began with their self-titled debut studio album in 1972. The band pioneered more musically sophisticated elements of glam rock while significantly influencing early English punk music, and provided a model for many new wave acts while innovating elements of electronic composition. The group also conveyed their distinctive brand of visual and musical sophistication with their focus on glamorous fashions. Ferry and co-founding member Eno have had influential solo careers. Eno became one of the most significant British record producers of the late 20th century. <i>Rolling Stone</i> originally ranked Roxy Music No. 98 on their greatest artists list  (""The Immortals – The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time""), but dropped the group from the list when they updated it in 2011.</p><p>Roxy Music's final studio album was <i>Avalon</i> (1982), which was certified Platinum in the United States. In 2005, the band began recording what would have become their ninth studio album—and their first album with Eno since 1973 (he wrote two songs for it and also played keyboards). However, Ferry eventually announced that the material from these sessions would instead be released as a Ferry solo studio album, with Eno playing on ""a couple of tracks"", and that he believed the group would never again produce a record as Roxy Music. The album was released in 2010 as the Ferry solo studio album <i>Olympia</i>. It featured contributions from Eno, Manzanera, and Mackay (amongst many other session players).
</p><p>In 2011, Roxy Music played a series of 40th-anniversary shows, but went inactive as a performing entity following the concerts. In 2019, Roxy Music were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.</p><p>In 2022 Roxy Music returned for a tour to mark the 50th anniversary of their debut studio album.</p>",

<p><b>Eric Alfred Leslie Satie</b> (<span><small>UK: </small></span>, <span><small>US: </small></span>; <small>French: </small><span title=""Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)"" lang=""fr-Latn-fonipa"">[eʁik sati]</span>; 17 May 1866 – 1 July 1925), who signed his name <b>Erik Satie</b> after 1884, was a French composer and pianist. He was the son of a French father and a British mother. He studied at the Paris Conservatoire, but was an undistinguished student and obtained no diploma. In the 1880s he worked as a pianist in café-cabaret in Montmartre, Paris, and began composing works, mostly for solo piano, such as his <i>Gymnopédies</i> and <i>Gnossiennes</i>. He also wrote music for a Rosicrucian sect to which he was briefly attached.
</p><p>After a spell in which he composed little, Satie entered Paris's second music academy, the Schola Cantorum, as a mature student. His studies there were more successful than those at the Conservatoire. From about 1910 he became the focus of successive groups of young composers attracted by his unconventionality and originality. Among them were the group known as Les Six. A meeting with Jean Cocteau in 1915 led to the creation of the ballet <i>Parade</i> (1917) for Serge Diaghilev, with music by Satie, sets and costumes by Pablo Picasso, and choreography by Léonide Massine.
</p><p>Satie's example guided a new generation of French composers away from post-Wagnerian impressionism towards a sparer, terser style. Among those influenced by him during his lifetime were Maurice Ravel and Francis Poulenc, and he is seen as an influence on more recent, minimalist composers such as John Cage and John Adams. His harmony is often characterised by unresolved chords, he sometimes dispensed with bar-lines, as in his <i>Gnossiennes</i>, and his melodies are generally simple and often reflect his love of old church music. He gave some of his later works absurd titles, such as <i>Veritables Preludes flasques (pour un chien)</i> (""True Flabby Preludes (for a Dog)"", 1912), <i>Croquis et agaceries d'un gros bonhomme en bois</i> (""Sketches and Exasperations of a Big Wooden Man"", 1913) and <i>Sonatine bureaucratique</i> (""Bureaucratic Sonatina"", 1917). Most of his works are brief, and the majority are for solo piano. Exceptions include his ""symphonic drama"" <i>Socrate</i> (1919) and two late ballets <i>Mercure</i> and <i>Relâche</i> (1924).
</p><p>Satie never married, and his home for most of his adult life was a single small room, first in Montmartre and, from 1898 to his death, in Arcueil, a suburb of Paris. He adopted various images over the years, including a period in quasi-priestly dress, another in which he always wore identically coloured velvet suits, and is known for his last persona, in neat bourgeois costume, with bowler hat, wing collar, and umbrella. He was a lifelong heavy drinker, and died of cirrhosis of the liver at the age of 59.

</p>
<p><b>Suede</b> (also known in the US as <b>The London Suede</b>) are an English rock band formed in London in 1989 by singer Brett Anderson, guitarist Justine Frischmann, and bass player Mat Osman. Drawing inspiration from glam rock and post-punk, Suede were dubbed ""The Best New Band in Britain"" by <i>Melody Maker</i> in 1992, and attracted much attention from the British music press. The following year their debut album <i>Suede</i> went to the top of the UK Albums Chart, becoming the fastest-selling debut album in almost ten years. It won the Mercury Music Prize and helped foster 'Britpop' as a musical movement, though the band distanced themselves from the term. 
</p><p>The recording sessions for their second album, <i>Dog Man Star</i>, were fraught with difficulty and ended with guitarist and composer Bernard Butler departing after confrontations with the other members. Guitarist and composer Richard Oakes replaced him and joined the band right before the accompanying tour. Although a commercial disappointment at the time, the album was met with a generally enthusiastic reception on release and has over time been lauded as one of rock music's great albums. In 1994, Suede would become a component of the Britpop ""big four"", along with Oasis, Blur and Pulp.</p><p>In 1996, following the recruitment of keyboard player Neil Codling, Suede went on to greater commercial success with <i>Coming Up</i>. The album reached number one in the UK, producing five top ten singles and becoming Suede's biggest-selling album worldwide. Despite problems within the band, Suede's fourth album, <i>Head Music</i> (1999), was a British chart-topper. The album was promoted heavily with the band receiving considerable press coverage on its release, however the response from fans and critics was less enthusiastic than for previous records. Codling left the band in 2001, citing chronic fatigue syndrome, and was replaced by Alex Lee. The band's fifth album, <i>A New Morning</i> (2002), the first following the collapse of Nude Records, was a commercial and critical disappointment, and the band disbanded the following year. In 2004, Anderson briefly reunited with Butler to form The Tears, before embarking on a solo career two years later.
</p><p>After much speculation Suede reformed in 2010 for a series of concerts. Three years on from their reunion gigs, Suede released their sixth album, <i>Bloodsports</i>. It was well received by critics and returned the band to the top ten in the UK. Their seventh album, <i>Night Thoughts</i>, followed in 2016 and became an even bigger critical and commercial success than its predecessor. Their eighth studio album, <i>The Blue Hour</i>, was released in September 2018. It became the group's first top five record since <i>Head Music</i>. Their ninth and most recent studio album, <i>Autofiction</i>, was released in September 2022.

</p>
<p><b>The Jam</b> were  an English mod revival/punk rock band formed in 1972 at Sheerwater Secondary School in Woking, Surrey. They released 18 consecutive Top 40 singles in the United Kingdom, from their debut in 1977 to their break-up in December 1982, including four number one hits. As of 2007, ""That's Entertainment"" and ""Just Who Is the 5 O'Clock Hero?"" remain the best-selling import singles of all time in the UK. They released one live album and six studio albums, the last of which, <i>The Gift</i>, reached number one on the UK Albums Chart. When the group disbanded in 1982, their first 15 singles were re-released and all placed within the top 100.</p><p>While the Jam shared the ""angry young man"" outlook and fast tempo of the mid-1970s British punk rock movement, in contrast with it the band wore smartly tailored suits reminiscent of English pop-bands in the early 1960s and incorporated mainstream 1960s rock and R&amp;B influences into its sound, particularly from the Who's work of that period and also drew influence from the work of the Kinks and the music of American Motown. This placed the act at the forefront of the 1970s–1980s nascent Mod Revival movement. With many of the band's lyrics about working class life, Jam biographer Sean Egan commented that they ""took social protest and cultural authenticity to the top of the charts.""</p><p>The band drew upon a variety of stylistic influences over the course of their career, including 1960s beat music, soul, rhythm and blues and psychedelic rock, as well as 1970s punk and new wave. The trio were known for their melodic pop songs, their distinctly English flavour and their mod image. The band launched the career of Paul Weller, who went on to form the Style Council and later his solo career. Weller wrote and sang most of the Jam's original compositions and played lead guitar, using a Rickenbacker 330. Bruce Foxton provided backing vocals and prominent basslines, which were the foundation of many of the band's songs, including the hits ""Down in the Tube Station at Midnight"", ""The Eton Rifles"", ""Going Underground"" and ""Town Called Malice"" mainly using a Rickenbacker 4001 or a Fender Precision Bass, as well as, on rare occasions, an Epiphone Rivoli.

</p><p>The band was founded by J Mascis (guitar, vocals, primary songwriter), Lou Barlow (bass, vocals), and Murph (drums). After three albums on independent labels, the band earned a reputation as one of the formative influences on American alternative rock. Creative tension led to Mascis firing Barlow, who later formed Sebadoh and Folk Implosion. His replacement, Mike Johnson, came aboard for three major-label albums. Murph eventually quit, with Mascis taking over drum duties on the band's albums before the group disbanded in 1997. The original lineup reformed in 2005, releasing five albums thereafter.</p><p>Mascis's drawling vocals and distinct guitar sound, hearkening back to 1960s and 1970s classic rock and characterized by extensive use of feedback and distortion, were highly influential in the alternative rock movement of the 1990s.</p>

All four members had previously played together in Delaney &amp; Bonnie and Friends, during and after Clapton's brief tenure with Blind Faith. Dave Mason supplied additional lead guitar on early studio sessions and played at their first live gig.

</p><p>The band released only one studio album, <i>Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs</i>, produced by Tom Dowd, which also featured extensive contributions on lead and slide guitar from Duane Allman. A double album, <i>Layla</i> did not immediately enjoy strong sales or receive widespread radio airplay, but went on to earn critical acclaim. Although released in 1970 it was not until March 1972 that the album's single ""Layla"" (a tale of unrequited love inspired by Clapton's infatuation with his friend George Harrison's wife, Pattie Boyd) made the top ten in both the United States and the United Kingdom.

</p>
<p><b>Dead Kennedys</b> are an American punk rock band that formed in San Francisco, California, in 1978. The band was one of the defining punk bands during its initial eight-year run.</p><p>Dead Kennedys' lyrics were usually political in nature, satirizing political figures and authority in general, as well as popular culture and even the punk movement itself. During their initial incarnation between 1978 and 1986, they attracted considerable controversy for their provocative lyrics and artwork. Several stores refused to stock their recordings, provoking debate about censorship in rock music; in the mid-1980s, vocalist and primary lyricist Jello Biafra became an active campaigner against the Parents Music Resource Center. This culminated in an obscenity trial between 1985 and 1986, which resulted in a hung jury.
</p><p>The group released a total of four studio albums and one EP before disbanding in 1986. Following the band's dissolution, Biafra continued to collaborate and record with other artists including D.O.A., NoMeansNo and his own bands Lard and the Guantanamo School of Medicine, as well as releasing several spoken word performances.
</p><p>In 2000 (upheld on appeal in 2003), Biafra lost an acrimonious legal case initiated by his former Dead Kennedys bandmates over songwriting credits and unpaid royalties. In 2001, the band reformed without Biafra; various singers have since been recruited for vocal duties. Although Dead Kennedys have continued to perform live over the years, they have not released any new material since the release of their fourth studio album <i>Bedtime for Democracy</i> in 1986.

The group has been through several personnel changes, including the replacement of every original member; notably Isberg in 1992. Mikael Åkerfeldt has been Opeth's frontman and primary songwriter since Isberg's departure. Opeth has consistently incorporated progressive, folk, blues, classical, and jazz influences into its usually lengthy compositions, as well as strong influences from death metal, especially in their early works. Many songs include acoustic guitar passages and strong dynamic shifts, as well as death growls. Opeth is also well known for their incorporation of Mellotrons in their work.

</p><p>Founded as the <b>Four Aims</b>, lead singer Levi Stubbs, Abdul ""Duke"" Fakir, Renaldo ""Obie"" Benson and Lawrence Payton remained together for over four decades, performing from 1953 until 1997 without a change in personnel. The Four Tops were among a number of groups, including the Miracles, the Marvelettes, Martha and the Vandellas, the Temptations, and the Supremes, who established the Motown Sound heard around the world during the 1960s. They were notable for having Stubbs, a baritone, as their lead singer, whereas most other male and mixed vocal groups of the time were fronted by tenors. 
</p><p>The group was the main male vocal group for the highly successful songwriting and production team of Holland–Dozier–Holland, who crafted a stream of hit singles for Motown. These included two <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 number-one hits for the Tops: ""I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch)"" in 1965 and ""Reach Out I'll Be There"" in 1966. The group continued to have chart singles into the 1970s, including the million-seller ""Ain't No Woman"" (1973).

<p><b>The Stranglers</b> are an English rock band who emerged via the punk rock scene. Scoring 23 UK top 40 singles and 19 UK top 40 albums to date in a career spanning five decades, the Stranglers are one of the longest-surviving bands to have originated in the UK punk scene.
</p><p>Formed as the Guildford Stranglers in Guildford, Surrey, in early 1974, they originally built a following within the mid-1970s pub rock scene. While their aggressive, no-compromise attitude had them identified by the media with the emerging UK punk rock scene that followed, their idiosyncratic approach rarely followed any single musical genre, and the group went on to explore a variety of musical styles, from new wave, art rock and gothic rock through the sophisti-pop of some of their 1980s output. They had major mainstream success with their 1982 single ""Golden Brown"". Their other hits include ""No More Heroes"", ""Peaches"", ""Always the Sun"", ""Skin Deep"" and ""Big Thing Coming"".
</p><p>The Stranglers' early sound was driven by Jean-Jacques Burnel's melodic bass, but also gave prominence to Dave Greenfield's keyboards. 
Their early music was also characterised by the growling vocals and sometimes misanthropic lyrics of both Burnel and Hugh Cornwell. Over time, their output gradually grew more refined and sophisticated. Summing up their contribution to popular music, critic Dave Thompson later wrote: ""From bad-mannered yobs to purveyors of supreme pop delicacies, the group was responsible for music that may have been ugly and might have been crude – but it was never, ever boring.""</p><p>Keyboard player Dave Greenfield died on 3 May 2020 after contracting COVID-19 while receiving treatment for a heart ailment.

The group was signed to fellow American rapper Eazy-E‘s Ruthless Records in late 1993, when they debuted with their EP <i>Creepin on ah Come Up</i>. The EP included their breakout hit single ""Thuggish Ruggish Bone"". In 1995, the group released its second album <i>E. 1999 Eternal</i>, which included hits ""1st of tha Month"" and ""East 1999"".

</p><p><i>The Art of War</i>, the group's third album, was released in 1997. In 2000, <i>BTNHResurrection</i> reached platinum status in the US in one month, while 2002's <i>Thug World Order</i> received more moderate sales and promotion, going gold and peaking at <abbr title=""Number"">No.</abbr> 3 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart.

Boyz II Men,Philadelphia,,Boyz II Men,"<p><b>Boyz II Men</b> (pronounced <i>boys to men</i>), also known as <b>B2M</b>, is an American vocal harmony group from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, best known for emotional ballads and a cappella harmonies. They are currently a trio composed of baritone Nathan Morris alongside tenors Wanyá Morris and Shawn Stockman. During the 1990s, Boyz II Men were a quartet, including bass singer Michael McCary, who left the group in 2003 due to health issues which were eventually diagnosed as multiple sclerosis.</p><p>The group gained international success in 1991, beginning with the release of top 5 singles ""Motownphilly"" and ""It's So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday."" Their number one single ""End of the Road"" was released in 1992, and topped music charts across the globe. ""End of the Road"" set a new record for longevity, holding the number one spot on <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 for thirteen weeks. Boyz II Men broke this record with the subsequent releases of ""I'll Make Love to You"" and ""One Sweet Day"" (with Mariah Carey), which, at fourteen and sixteen weeks, respectively, each set new records for the total number of weeks at number one. ""I'll Make Love to You"" topped the charts in Australia for four weeks and garnered international success.
</p><p>Consequently, Boyz II Men is among the music industry's elite with regard to time spent at number one in <i>Billboard</i> history - with 50 cumulative weeks. They rank sixth behind Drake, the Beatles, Rihanna, Elvis Presley and Carey. Furthermore, when ""On Bended Knee"" took the number one spot away from ""I'll Make Love to You"", Boyz II Men became only the third artists ever (after the Beatles and Presley) to replace themselves at the top of the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. These achievements were enough to earn Boyz II Men recognition as <i>Billboard</i> magazine's biggest boy band during the period of 1987 to 2012. Boyz II Men has received four Grammy Awards.
</p><p>Boyz II Men continue to perform worldwide, as a trio. Their most recent studio album, <i>Under the Streetlight</i>, was released in 2017.</p><p>In June 2017, a section of Broad Street (from Christian to Carpenter Streets) in Philadelphia was renamed ""Boyz II Men Boulevard"".

<p><b>Porcupine Tree</b> are  an English rock band formed by musician Steven Wilson in 1987. During an initial career spanning more than twenty years, they earned critical acclaim from critics and fellow musicians, developed a cult following, and became an influence for new artists. The group carved out a career at a certain distance away from mainstream music, being described by publications such as <i>Classic Rock</i> and <i>PopMatters</i> as ""the most important band you’d never heard of"".</p><p>The band began as a solo project for Wilson, who initially created all of the band's music himself. By late 1993, however, he wanted to work in a band environment, bringing on frequent collaborators Richard Barbieri as keyboardist, Colin Edwin as bassist, and Chris Maitland as drummer to form the first permanent lineup. With Wilson as lead vocalist and guitarist, this remained the lineup until February 2002, when Maitland left the band and Gavin Harrison was recruited to replace him. Porcupine Tree's early sound evoked various styles of psychedelic rock, space rock and experimental rock, later moving towards a more progressive/space rock direction comparable to that of Pink Floyd. Upon signing with Kscope record label in the late 1990s, the band began to approach a more mainstream alternative rock sound. By the early 2000s, the band had signed to a major record label and shifted their sound again, this time in a more progressive metal direction. 
</p><p>In 2010, after the tour in support of their 2009 studio album <i>The Incident</i>, the band became publicly inactive as Wilson committed himself to his solo work and other members began working on their own separate projects. However, Wilson, Barbieri and Harrison continued to intermittently work on material in secrecy over the course of the following decade, leading to the release of their album <i>Closure/Continuation</i> on 24 June 2022.

<p><b>Twisted Sister</b> was an American heavy metal band originally from Ho-Ho-Kus, New Jersey, and later based on Long Island, New York. Their best-known songs include ""We're Not Gonna Take It"" and ""I Wanna Rock"", both of which were associated with music videos noted for their sense of slapstick humor.
</p><p>Twisted Sister evolved from a band named Silver Star, and experienced several membership changes before settling on the classic lineup of Jay Jay French (guitars), Eddie ""Fingers"" Ojeda (guitars), Dee Snider (lead vocals), Mark ""The Animal"" Mendoza (bass), and A. J. Pero (drums) in 1982.  It was this lineup which recorded the band's first four albums. Twisted Sister's first two albums, <i>Under the Blade</i> (1982)  and <i>You Can't Stop Rock 'n' Roll</i> (1983), were critically well received and earned the band underground popularity. The band achieved mainstream success with their third album, <i>Stay Hungry</i> (1984), and its single ""We're Not Gonna Take It"", which was their only Top 40 hit on the Billboard Hot 100. Their next two albums, <i>Come Out and Play</i> (1985) and <i>Love Is for Suckers</i> (1987), did not match the success of <i>Stay Hungry</i>, and Twisted Sister disbanded in 1988.
</p><p>The band briefly reunited in the late 1990s before more permanently reforming in 2003. The band released two more albums: <i>Still Hungry</i> (2004), a rerecording of their third album, and the Christmas album, <i>A Twisted Christmas</i> (2006). Following Pero's death in 2015, the band embarked on a farewell tour and broke up again after completing the tour in 2016.
</p><p>Although Twisted Sister is often regarded as glam metal due to its use of makeup, Snider considers the term to be inappropriate. Twisted Sister is also ranked No. 73 among VH1's 100 greatest artists of hard rock.</p>

</p><p>Their second album, <i>Days of Future Passed</i>, which was released in 1967, was a fusion of rock with classical music which established the band as pioneers in the development of art rock and progressive rock. It has been described as a ""landmark"" and ""one of the first successful concept albums"". The group toured extensively through the early 1970s, then took an extended hiatus from 1974 until 1977. Founder Mike Pinder left the group a year after they re-formed and was replaced by Swiss keyboardist Patrick Moraz in 1978. In the following decade they took on a more synth-pop sound and produced <i>The Other Side of Life</i> in 1986, which made them the first act to earn each of its first three top-10 singles in the United States in a different decade. Health troubles led to a diminished role for founder Ray Thomas throughout the 1980s, although his musical contributions rebounded after Moraz departed in 1991.  Thomas retired from the band in 2002; he died shortly before the band were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2018.
</p><p>The band's last album was the Christmas album <i>December</i> (2003), after which they decided against recording any further studio albums. However, they continued to tour throughout the 2000s and later reunited periodically for events, one-off concerts, short tours and cruises, until Edge's retirement in 2018; he died in 2021.
</p><p>The Moody Blues' most successful singles include ""Go Now"", ""Nights in White Satin"", ""Tuesday Afternoon"", ""Question"", ""Gemini Dream"", ""The Voice"", ""Your Wildest Dreams"" and ""I'm Just a Singer (In a Rock and Roll Band)"". The band has sold 70 million albums worldwide, which includes 18 platinum and gold LPs.

</p>
<p><b>Devo</b> (<span></span>, originally <span></span>) is an American rock band from Akron, Ohio, formed in 1973. Their classic line-up consisted of two sets of brothers, the Mothersbaughs (Mark and Bob) and the Casales (Gerald and Bob), along with Alan Myers. The band had a No. 14 <i>Billboard</i> chart hit in 1980 with the single ""Whip It"", the song that gave the band mainstream popularity.
</p><p>Devo's music and visual presentation (including stage shows and costumes) mingle kitsch science fiction themes, deadpan surrealist humor and mordantly satirical social commentary. The band's namesake, the tongue-in-cheek social theory of ""de-evolution"", was an integral concept in their early work, which was marked by experimental and dissonant art punk that merged rock music with electronics. Their output in the 1980s embraced synth-pop and a more mainstream, less conceptual style, though the band's satirical and quirky humor remained intact. Their music has proven influential on subsequent movements, particularly on new wave, industrial, and alternative rock artists. Devo (most enthusiastically Gerald Casale) was also a pioneer of the music video format.

The band's third album <i>Subhuman Race</i> (1995) was also critically acclaimed, but failed to repeat the success of its predecessors.

Ricky Wilson died of AIDS-related illness in 1985, and Strickland switched from drums to lead guitar. The band also added various members for albums and live performances.
</p><p>The group evoked a ""thrift shop aesthetic"", in Bernard Gendron's words, by drawing from 1950s and 1960s pop sources, trash culture, and rock and roll. Schneider, Pierson, and Wilson sometimes use call-and-response-style vocals (Schneider's often humorous sprechgesang contrasting with Wilson's and Pierson's melodic harmonies), and their guitar- and keyboard-driven instrumentation is their trademark sound, which was also set apart from their contemporaries by the unusual guitar tunings Ricky Wilson used on their earlier albums.

<p><b>Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark</b> (<b>OMD</b>) are an English electronic band formed in Wirral, Merseyside, in 1978. The group consists of co-founders Andy McCluskey (vocals, bass guitar) and Paul Humphreys (keyboards, vocals), along with Martin Cooper (keyboards, saxophone) and Stuart Kershaw (drums); McCluskey has been the only constant member. Regarded as pioneers of electronic music, OMD combined an experimental, minimalist ethos with pop sensibilities, becoming key figures in the late-1970s/early-1980s emergence of synth-pop. The band were also one of the original acts involved in the MTV-driven Second British Invasion of the US.
</p><p>McCluskey and Humphreys led precursor group the Id from 1977–1978, and re-recorded their track ""Electricity"" as OMD's debut single in 1979. Weathering an ""uncool"" image and a degree of hostility from music critics, the band achieved popularity throughout Europe with the 1980 anti-war song ""Enola Gay"", and gained further recognition via <i>Architecture &amp; Morality</i> (1981) and its three hit singles. Although later reappraised, <i>Dazzle Ships</i> (1983) was seen as overly experimental, and eroded European support. The group embraced a more radio-friendly sound on <i>Junk Culture</i> (1984); this change in direction led to greater success in the United States, and spawned hits including ""If You Leave"" (from the 1986 film <i>Pretty in Pink</i>).
</p><p>In 1989, creative differences saw Humphreys and other members form the spin-off band the Listening Pool, leaving McCluskey the only remaining member of OMD. The group returned with a new line-up and explored the dance-pop genre: <i>Sugar Tax</i> (1991) and its initial singles were hits in Europe. OMD then began to flounder amid the guitar-oriented grunge and Britpop movements, eventually disbanding in 1996. McCluskey later conceived girl group Atomic Kitten, for whom he served as a principal songwriter and producer, while Humphreys formed the duo Onetwo alongside lead vocalist Claudia Brücken of Propaganda.
</p><p>In 2006, OMD reformed with Humphreys and McCluskey revisiting the experimental territory of their early work; the band have achieved 13 top-20 entries on the UK Albums Chart. Their 20th century output yielded 18 top-40 appearances on the UK Singles Chart, as well as four top-40 entries on the US <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. Although sometimes identified as a cult band, OMD have sold over 40 million records worldwide, and have influenced the work of many other recording artists.
