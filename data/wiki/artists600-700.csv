<p><b>Roy Kelton Orbison</b> (April 23, 1936 – December 6, 1988) was an American singer, songwriter, and musician known for his impassioned singing style, complex song structures, and dark, emotional ballads. His music was described by critics as operatic, earning him the nicknames ""The Caruso of Rock"" and ""The Big O."" Many of Orbison's songs conveyed vulnerability at a time when most male rock-and-roll performers chose to project machismo. He performed while standing motionless and wearing black clothes to match his dyed black hair and dark sunglasses.
</p><p>Born in Texas, Orbison began singing in a rockabilly and country-and-western band as a teenager. He was signed by Sam Phillips of Sun Records in 1956, but enjoyed his greatest success with Monument Records. From 1960 to 1966, 22 of Orbison's singles reached the <i>Billboard</i> Top 40. He wrote or co-wrote almost all of his own Top 10 hits, including ""Only the Lonely"" (1960), ""Running Scared"" (1961), ""Crying"" (1961), ""In Dreams"" (1963), and ""Oh, Pretty Woman"" (1964).
</p><p>After the mid-1960s, Orbison suffered a number of personal tragedies and his career faltered. He experienced a resurgence in popularity in the 1980s following the success of several cover versions of his songs. In 1988, he co-founded the Traveling Wilburys (a rock  supergroup) with George Harrison, Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, and Jeff Lynne. Orbison died of a heart attack in December 1988 at age 52. One month later, his song ""You Got It"" (1989) was released as a solo single, becoming his first hit to reach the US and UK Top 10 in nearly 25 years.
</p><p>Orbison's honors include inductions into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1987, the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1989, and the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in 2014. He received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and five other Grammy Awards. <i>Rolling Stone</i> placed him at number 37 on its list of the ""Greatest Artists of All Time"" and number 13 on its list of the ""100 Greatest Singers of All Time"". In 2002, <i>Billboard</i> magazine listed him at number 74 on its list of the Top 600 recording artists.

</p>
<p><b>Harry Lillis</b> ""<b>Bing</b>"" <b>Crosby Jr.</b> (May 3, 1903 – October 14, 1977) was an American singer and actor. The first multimedia star, he was one of the most popular and influential musical artists of the 20th century worldwide. He was a leader in record sales, radio ratings, and motion picture grosses from 1926 to 1977. He was one of the first global cultural icons. He made over 70 feature films and recorded more than 1,600 songs.</p><p>His early career coincided with recording innovations that allowed him to develop an intimate singing style that influenced many male singers who followed, such as Frank Sinatra, Perry Como, Dean Martin, Dick Haymes, Elvis Presley, and John Lennon. <i>Yank</i> magazine said that he was ""the person who had done the most for the morale of overseas servicemen"" during World War II. In 1948, American polls declared him the ""most admired man alive"", ahead of Jackie Robinson and Pope Pius XII.<sup class=""reference nowrap""><span title=""Page / location: 6"">: 6 </span></sup> In 1948, <i>Music Digest</i> estimated that his recordings filled more than half of the 80,000 weekly hours allocated to recorded radio music in America.</p><p>Crosby won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance in <i>Going My Way</i> (1944) and was nominated for its sequel, <i>The Bells of St. Mary's</i> (1945), opposite Ingrid Bergman, becoming the first of six actors to be nominated twice for playing the same character. He was the number one box office attraction for five consecutive years, 1944 to 1948. At his screen apex in 1946, Crosby starred in three of the year's five highest-grossing films: <i>The Bells of St. Mary's</i>, <i>Blue Skies</i> and <i>Road to Utopia</i>.

He is one of 33 people to have three stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, in the categories of motion pictures, radio, and audio recording. He was also known for his collaborations with his friend Bob Hope, starring in the <i>Road to...</i> films from 1940 to 1962.
</p><p>Crosby influenced the development of the post World War II recording industry. After seeing a demonstration of a German broadcast quality reel-to-reel tape recorder brought to the United States by John T. Mullin, he invested $50,000 in the California electronics company Ampex to build copies. He then persuaded ABC to allow him to tape his shows. He became the first performer to prerecord his radio shows and master his commercial recordings onto magnetic tape. Crosby has been associated with the Christmas season since Irving Berlin's musical film <i>Holiday Inn</i>, in which he starred and sang songs such as ""White Christmas"" and ""Happy Holiday"". Through audio recordings, he produced his radio programs with the same directorial tools and craftsmanship (editing, retaking, rehearsal, time shifting) used in motion picture production, a practice that became the industry standard. In addition to his work with early audio tape recording, he helped finance the development of videotape, bought television stations, bred racehorses, and co-owned the Pittsburgh Pirates baseball team, during which time the team won two World Series (1960 and 1971).

<p><b>Roberta Joan</b> ""<b>Joni</b>"" <b>Mitchell</b>  (née <b>Anderson</b>; born November 7, 1943) is a Canadian-American musician, producer, and painter. Among the most influential singer-songwriters to emerge from the 1960s folk music circuit, Mitchell became known for her starkly personal lyrics and unconventional compositions, which grew to incorporate pop and jazz influences. She has received many accolades, including ten Grammy Awards and induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997. <i>Rolling Stone</i> called her ""one of the greatest songwriters ever"", and AllMusic has stated, ""When the dust settles, Joni Mitchell may stand as the most important and influential female recording artist of the late 20th century"".</p><p>Mitchell began singing in small nightclubs in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, and throughout western Canada, before moving on to the nightclubs of Toronto, Ontario. She moved to the United States and began touring in 1965. Some of her original songs (""Urge for Going"", ""Chelsea Morning"", ""Both Sides, Now"", ""The Circle Game"") were recorded by other folk singers, allowing her to sign with Reprise Records and record her debut album, <i>Song to a Seagull</i>, in 1968. Settling in Southern California, Mitchell helped define an era and a generation with popular songs like ""Big Yellow Taxi"" and ""Woodstock"". Her 1971 album <i>Blue</i> is often cited as one of the best albums of all time; it was rated the 30th best album ever made in <i>Rolling Stone</i><span>'</span>s 2003 list of the ""500 Greatest Albums of All Time"", rising to number 3 in the 2020 edition. In 2000, <i>The New York Times</i> chose <i>Blue</i> as one of the 25 albums that represented ""turning points and pinnacles in 20th-century popular music"". NPR ranked <i>Blue</i> number 1 on a 2017 list of Greatest Albums Made By Women.</p><p>Mitchell switched labels and began exploring more jazz-influenced ideas, by way of lush pop textures, on 1974's <i>Court and Spark</i>, which featured the radio hits ""Help Me"" and ""Free Man in Paris"" and became her best-selling album. Mitchell's vocal range began to shift from mezzo-soprano to more of a wide-ranging contralto around 1975. Her distinctive piano and open-tuned guitar compositions also grew more harmonically and rhythmically complex as she melded jazz with rock and roll, R&amp;B, classical music and non-Western beats. In the late 1970s, she began working with noted jazz musicians including Jaco Pastorius, Tom Scott, Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, and Pat Metheny as well as Charles Mingus, who asked her to collaborate on his final recordings. She later turned to pop and electronic music and engaged in political protest. She was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 44th Annual Grammy Awards in 2002.</p><p>Mitchell produced or co-produced most of her albums and designed most of her own album covers, describing herself as a ""painter derailed by circumstance"". A critic of the music industry, she quit touring and released her 17th and last album of original songs in 2007.  She would give occasional interviews and make appearances to speak on various causes over the next two decades, though the rupture of a brain aneurysm in 2015 led to a long period of recovery and therapy.  A series of retrospective compilations were released over the time period, culminating in the Joni Mitchell Archives, a project to publish much of Joni's unreleased material from her long career.  She returned to public appearances in 2021, accepting several awards in person, including a Kennedy Center Honor in 2021.  She performed live for the first time in 9 years, with an unannounced appearance at the June 2022 Newport Folk Festival, and is scheduled to perform a headline show on June 10, 2023.

</p>
<p><b>Nancy Sandra Sinatra</b> (born June 8, 1940) is an American  singer and actress. She is the elder daughter of Frank Sinatra and Nancy Sinatra (<span title=""Name at birth"">née </span> Barbato), and is best known for her 1966 signature hit ""These Boots Are Made for Walkin'<span>""</span>.
</p><p>Nancy Sinatra began her career as a singer and actress in November 1957 with an appearance on her father's ABC-TV variety series, but initially achieved success only in Europe and Japan. In early 1966 she had a transatlantic number-one hit with ""These Boots Are Made for Walkin<span>'</span>"". A TV promo clip from the era features Sinatra in high boots, accompanied by colorfully dressed go-go dancers, in what is now considered an iconic Swinging Sixties look. The song was written by Lee Hazlewood, who wrote and produced most of her hits and sang with her on several duets. As with all of Sinatra's 1960s hits, ""Boots"" featured Billy Strange as arranger and conductor.
</p><p>Between early 1966 and early 1968, Sinatra charted on <i>Billboard'</i>s Hot 100 with 14 titles, ten of which reached the Top 40. In addition to ""These Boots Are Made for Walkin<span>'</span>"", defining recordings during this period include ""Sugar Town"", ""Love Eyes"", the transatlantic 1967 number one ""Somethin' Stupid"" (a duet with her father), two versions of the title song from the James Bond film <i>You Only Live Twice</i> (1967), several collaborations with Lee Hazlewood – including ""Summer Wine"", ""Jackson"", ""Lady Bird"" and ""Some Velvet Morning"" – and a non-single 1966 cover of the Cher hit ""Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)"", which features in the opening credits of Quentin Tarantino's 2003 film <i>Kill Bill Volume 1</i>. In 1971 Sinatra and Hazlewood achieved their first collaborative success in the UK singles chart with the no. 2 hit ""Did You Ever?"", and the 2005 UK no. 3 hit by Audio Bullys, ""Shot You Down"", sampled Sinatra's version of ""Bang Bang"".
</p><p>Between 1964 and 1968 Sinatra appeared in several feature films, co-starring with Peter Fonda in Roger Corman's biker-gang movie <i>The Wild Angels</i> (1966) and alongside Elvis Presley in the musical drama <i>Speedway</i> (1968). Frank and Nancy Sinatra played a fictional father and daughter in the 1965 comedy <i>Marriage on the Rocks</i>.

<p><b>Samuel Cook</b> (January 22, 1931 – December 11, 1964), known professionally as <b>Sam Cooke</b>, was an American singer and songwriter. Considered to be a pioneer and one of the most influential soul artists of all time, Cooke is commonly referred to as the ""King of Soul"" for his distinctive vocals, notable contributions to the genre and significance in popular music.</p><p>Cooke was born in Clarksdale, Mississippi and later relocated to Chicago with his family at a young age, where he began singing as a child and joined the Soul Stirrers as lead singer in the 1950s. Going solo in 1957, Cooke released a string of hit songs, including ""You Send Me"", ""A Change Is Gonna Come"", ""Cupid"", ""Wonderful World"", ""Chain Gang"", ""Twistin' the Night Away"", ""Bring It On Home to Me"", and ""Good Times"". During his eight-year career, Cooke released 29 singles that charted in the Top 40 of the <i>Billboard</i> Pop Singles chart, as well as 20 singles in the Top Ten of <i>Billboard</i><span>'s</span> Black Singles chart.

</p><p>Cooke's pioneering contributions to soul music contributed to the rise of Aretha Franklin, Bobby Womack, Al Green, Curtis Mayfield, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, and Billy Preston, and popularized the work of Otis Redding and James Brown. AllMusic biographer Bruce Eder wrote that Cooke was ""the inventor of soul music"", and possessed ""an incredible natural singing voice and a smooth, effortless delivery that has never been surpassed"".</p><p>Cooke was also a central part of the civil rights movement, using his influence and popularity with the White and Black populations to fight for the cause. He was friends with boxer Muhammad Ali, activist Malcolm X and football player Jim Brown, who together campaigned for racial equality.

Пётр Ильич Чайковский,,05|07|df=y,Votkinsk,,,Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky,"<link rel=""mw-deduplicated-inline-style"" href=""mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096"">
<p class=""mw-empty-elt"">
</p>
<p><b>Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky</b> (<span></span> <i title=""English pronunciation respelling"">chy-<span>KOF</span>-skee</i>; 7 May 1840 – 6 November 1893) was a Russian composer of the Romantic period. He was the first Russian composer whose music would make a lasting impression internationally. He wrote some of the most popular concert and theatrical music in the current classical repertoire, including the ballets <i>Swan Lake</i> and <i>The Nutcracker</i>, the <i>1812 Overture</i>, his First Piano Concerto, Violin Concerto, the <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> Overture-Fantasy, several symphonies, and the opera <i>Eugene Onegin</i>.
</p><p>Although musically precocious, Tchaikovsky was educated for a career as a civil servant as there was little opportunity for a musical career in Russia at the time and no system of public music education. When an opportunity for such an education arose, he entered the nascent Saint Petersburg Conservatory, from which he graduated in 1865. The formal Western-oriented teaching that he received there set him apart from composers of the contemporary nationalist movement embodied by the Russian composers of The Five with whom his professional relationship was mixed.
</p><p>Tchaikovsky's training set him on a path to reconcile what he had learned with the native musical practices to which he had been exposed from childhood. From that reconciliation, he forged a personal but unmistakably Russian style. The principles that governed melody, harmony and other fundamentals of Russian music ran completely counter to those that governed Western European music, which seemed to defeat the potential for using Russian music in large-scale Western composition or for forming a composite style, and it caused personal antipathies that dented Tchaikovsky's self-confidence. Russian culture exhibited a split personality, with its native and adopted elements having drifted apart increasingly since the time of Peter the Great. That resulted in uncertainty among the intelligentsia about the country's national identity, an ambiguity mirrored in Tchaikovsky's career.
</p><p>Despite his many popular successes, Tchaikovsky's life was punctuated by personal crises and depression. Contributory factors included his early separation from his mother for boarding school followed by his mother's early death, the death of his close friend and colleague Nikolai Rubinstein, his failed marriage with Antonina Miliukova, and the collapse of his 13-year association with the wealthy patroness Nadezhda von Meck. His homosexuality, which he kept private, has traditionally also been considered a major factor though some scholars have downplayed its importance. Tchaikovsky's dedication of his Sixth symphony to his nephew Vladimir “Bob” Davydov (13 at the time) and his feelings expressed about Davydov in letters to others, especially following Davydov's suicide, have been cited as evidence for a romantic love between the two. Tchaikovsky's sudden death at the age of 53 is generally ascribed to cholera, but there is an ongoing debate as to whether cholera was indeed the cause and whether the death was accidental or intentional.
</p><p>While his music has remained popular among audiences, critical opinions were initially mixed. Some Russians did not feel it was sufficiently representative of native musical values and expressed suspicion that Europeans accepted the music for its Western elements. In an apparent reinforcement of the latter claim, some Europeans lauded Tchaikovsky for offering music more substantive than base exoticism and said he transcended stereotypes of Russian classical music. Others dismissed Tchaikovsky's music as ""lacking in elevated thought"" and derided its formal workings as deficient because they did not stringently follow Western principles.

</p>
<p><b>Willie Hugh Nelson</b> (born April 29, 1933) is an American singer, songwriter, musician, political activist and actor. He was one of the main figures of outlaw country, a subgenre of country music that developed in the late 1960s as a reaction to the conservative restrictions of the Nashville sound. The critical success of his album <i>Shotgun Willie</i> (1973), combined with the critical and commercial success of <i>Red Headed Stranger</i> (1975) and <i>Stardust</i> (1978), made Nelson one of the most recognized artists in country music. Nelson has acted in over 30 films, co-authored several books, and has been involved in activism for the use of biofuels and the legalization of marijuana.
</p><p>Born during the Great Depression and raised by his grandparents, Nelson wrote his first song at age seven and joined his first band at ten. During high school, he toured locally with the Bohemian Polka as their lead singer and guitar player. After graduating from high school in 1950, he joined the U.S. Air Force but was later discharged due to back problems. After his return, Nelson attended Baylor University for two years but dropped out because he was succeeding in music. He worked as a disc jockey at radio stations in his native Texas, and in several radio stations in the Pacific Northwest, all the while working as a singer and songwriter throughout the late 1950s. During that time, he wrote songs that would become country standards, including ""Funny How Time Slips Away"", ""Hello Walls"", ""Pretty Paper"", and ""Crazy"". In 1960 he moved to Nashville, Tennessee, and later signed a publishing contract with Pamper Music which allowed him to join Ray Price's band as a bassist. In 1962, he recorded his first album, <i>...And Then I Wrote</i>. Due to this success, Nelson signed in 1964 with RCA Victor and joined the Grand Ole Opry the following year. After mid-chart hits in the late 1960s and the early 1970s, Nelson grew weary of the corporate Nashville music scene, and in 1972 he moved to Austin, Texas. The ongoing music scene of Austin motivated Nelson to return to performing, appearing frequently at the Armadillo World Headquarters.
</p><p>In 1973, after signing with Atlantic Records, Nelson turned to outlaw country, including albums such as <i>Shotgun Willie</i> and <i>Phases and Stages</i>. In 1975, he switched to Columbia Records, where he recorded the critically acclaimed album <i>Red Headed Stranger</i>. The same year, he recorded another outlaw country album, <i>Wanted! The Outlaws</i>, along with Waylon Jennings, Jessi Colter, and Tompall Glaser. During the mid-1980s, while creating hit albums like <i>Honeysuckle Rose</i> and recording hit songs like ""On the Road Again"", ""To All the Girls I've Loved Before"", and ""Pancho and Lefty"", he joined the country supergroup The Highwaymen, along with fellow singers Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, and Kris Kristofferson. In 1985, he helped organize the first Farm Aid concert to benefit American farmers; the concerts have been held annually ever since and Nelson has been a fixture, appearing at every one.
</p><p>In 1990, Nelson's assets were seized by the Internal Revenue Service, which claimed that he owed $32<span> </span>million. The difficulty of paying his outstanding debt was aggravated by weak investments he had made during the 1980s. In 1992, Nelson released <i>The IRS Tapes: Who'll Buy My Memories?</i>; the profits of the double album—destined to the IRS—and the auction of Nelson's assets cleared his debt. During the 1990s and 2000s, Nelson continued touring extensively, and released albums every year. Reviews ranged from positive to mixed. He explored genres such as reggae, blues, jazz, and folk.
</p><p>Nelson made his first movie appearance in the 1979 film <i>The Electric Horseman</i>, followed by other appearances in movies and on television. Nelson is a major liberal activist and the co-chair of the advisory board of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML), which is in favor of marijuana legalization. On the environmental front, Nelson owns the biodiesel brand Willie Nelson Biodiesel, whose product is made from vegetable oil. Nelson is also the honorary chairman of the advisory board of the Texas Music Project, the official music charity of the state of Texas.
