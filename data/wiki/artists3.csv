He is known for his musical versatility, with his discography spanning Latin pop, pop, dance, reggaeton, and salsa genres. Dubbed the ""King of Latin Pop"", the ""King of Latin Music"", and the ""Latin Pop God"", he is regarded as one of the most influential artists in the world. Born in San Juan, Martin began appearing in television commercials at age nine and began his musical career at twelve, as a member of Puerto Rican boy band Menudo. He began his solo career in 1991 while in Sony Music Mexico, gaining recognition in Latin America with the release of his first two studio albums, <i>Ricky Martin</i> (1991) and <i>Me Amaras</i> (1993), both of which were focused on ballads.
</p><p>Martin's third album, <i>A Medio Vivir</i> (1995), helped him rise to prominence in European countries. The chart-topping single ""María"", incorporated a mixture of Latin music genres and became his first international hit. His international success was further solidified with his fourth album, <i>Vuelve</i> (1998). The album, which earned Martin his first Grammy Award, spawned chart-topping songs ""Vuelve"" and ""La Copa de la Vida"". Martin performed the latter at the 41st Annual Grammy Awards, which was greeted with a massive standing ovation and is known as a game-changer for Latin music worldwide. His first English album, <i>Ricky Martin</i> (1999) became his first US <i>Billboard</i> 200 number one. The lead single ""Livin' la Vida Loca"" topped both the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart. Martin's success in the late 1990s is generally seen as the beginning of the ""Latin explosion"".

As an actor, Martin gained popularity and stardom for his role in the hit soap opera <i>General Hospital</i> (1994–1996), while his portrayal of Antonio D'Amico in <i>The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story</i> (2018) marked the acting opportunity of his career, garnering him an Emmy nomination. He also starred as Ché in the Broadway revival of the musical <i>Evita</i> in 2012, which broke the theater's box-office sales record seven times.
</p><p>Martin is one of the best-selling Latin music artists of all time, having sold over 70 million records worldwide.

Daddy Yankee,artist,,1977|2|3,San Juan,1990–2023,,Daddy Yankee,"<p class=""mw-empty-elt"">


</p>

<p><b>Ramón Luis Ayala Rodríguez</b> (born February 3, 1977), known professionally as <b>Daddy Yankee</b>, is a retired Puerto Rican rapper, singer, songwriter, and actor. Known as the ""King of Reggaeton"" by music critics and fans alike, he is the artist who coined the word <i>reggaeton</i> in 1991 in the mixtape Playero 34 in the song ""So persigueme, no te detengas"" to describe the new music genre that was emerging from Puerto Rico that synthesized American hip-hop, Hispanic Caribbean music, and Jamaican reggae rhythms with Spanish rapping and singing. He is often cited as an influence by other Hispanic urban performers.
</p><p>Ayala was born in Río Piedras and was raised in the Villa Kennedy Housing Projects neighborhood. He aspired to be a professional baseball player and tried out for the Seattle Mariners of Major League Baseball. Before he could be officially signed, he was hit by a stray round from an AK-47 rifle while taking a break from a studio recording session with reggaeton artist DJ Playero. Ayala spent roughly a year and a half recovering from the wound; the bullet was never removed from his hip, and he credits the shooting incident with allowing him to focus entirely on a music career.</p><p>In 2004, Daddy Yankee released his international hit single ""Gasolina"", which is credited with introducing reggaeton to audiences worldwide, and making the music genre a global phenomenon. Since then, he has sold around 30 million records, making him one of the best-selling Latin music artists. Daddy Yankee's album <i>Barrio Fino</i> made history when it became the top-selling Latin music album of the decade between 2000 and 2009.</p><p>In 2017, Daddy Yankee, in collaboration with Latin pop singer Luis Fonsi, released the hit single ""Despacito"". It became the first Spanish-language song to hit number one on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 since ""Macarena"" in 1996. The single gained global success. The video for ""Despacito"" on YouTube received its billionth view on April 20, 2017, and became the most-watched video on the platform. Its success led Daddy Yankee to become the most-listened artist worldwide on the streaming service Spotify in June 2017, the first Latin artist to do so. In March 2022, Daddy Yankee announced that he would be retiring from music after the release of his seventh studio album <i>Legendaddy</i> and its supporting tour.</p><p>During his career, Daddy Yankee earned numerous accolades, including five Latin Grammy Awards, two <i>Billboard</i> Music Awards, 14 <i>Billboard</i> Latin Music Awards, two Latin American Music Awards, eight Lo Nuestro Awards, an MTV Video Music Award, and six ASCAP Awards. He also received a Puerto Rican Walk of Fame star, special awards by <i>People en Español</i> magazine, and the Presencia Latina at Harvard University. He was named by CNN as the ""Most Influential Hispanic Artist"" of 2009, and included in <i>Time</i> 100 in 2006.</p>

</p>

<p><b>Clyde Jackson Browne</b> (born October 9, 1948) is an American musician, singer, songwriter, and political activist who has sold over 18 million records in the United States.</p><p>Emerging as a precocious teenage songwriter in mid-1960s Los Angeles, he experienced his first successes writing songs for others, writing ""These Days"" as a 16-year-old; the song became a minor hit for the German singer and Andy Warhol protégé Nico in 1967. He also wrote several songs for fellow Southern California bands the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, which he was briefly a member in 1966, and the Eagles, the latter of whom had their first US <i>Billboard</i> Top 40 hit in 1972 with the Browne co-written song ""Take It Easy"".
</p><p>Encouraged by his successes writing songs for others, Browne released his self-titled debut album in 1972, which spawned two Top 40 hits of his own, ""Doctor, My Eyes"" and ""Rock Me on the Water"". For his debut album, as well as for the next several albums and concert tours, Browne started working closely with the Section, a prolific session band that also worked with a variety of other prominent singer-songwriters at the time. His second album, <i>For Everyman</i>, was released in 1973, and while it lacked an enduring single, has been retrospectively assessed as some of his best work, appearing highly on several ""Best Album of All Time"" lists. His third album, <i>Late for the Sky</i>, was his most successful to that point, peaking at number 14 on the US <i>Billboard</i> 200 album chart. His fourth album, <i>The Pretender</i>, continued the pattern of each album topping the previous by peaking at number 5 on the album chart, and spawned the hit singles ""Here Come Those Tears Again"" and ""The Pretender"".
</p><p>It would be the 1977 album <i>Running on Empty</i>, however, that would become his signature work, peaking at number 3 on the album chart, and remaining there for over a year. Both a live album and a concept album, the songs on the album explore the themes of life as a touring musician, and the album was recorded both on stage, and in places touring musicians spend time when not playing, such as hotel rooms, backstage, and in one case on a moving tour bus. The album produced two Top 40 singles, ""Running on Empty"" and ""The Load-Out/Stay"", and many of the other tracks became popular radio hits on the AOR format.
</p><p>Successful albums continued through the 1980s, including the 1980 album <i>Hold Out</i>, his only number 1 album, the non-album single ""Somebody's Baby"", which was used in the film <i>Fast Times at Ridgemont High</i>, and 1983's <i>Lawyers in Love</i>, which included the hit single ""Tender Is the Night"". In 1986, he released <i>Lives in the Balance</i>, which had several radio hits and included the introspective ""In the Shape of a Heart"", which was inspired by the suicide of his first wife a decade prior. His string of hit albums came to an end at that point, as his next several albums failed to produce a gold or platinum RIAA rating.
</p><p>He released two compilation albums, <i>The Next Voice You Hear: The Best of Jackson Browne</i> in 1997, and <i>The Very Best of Jackson Browne</i>, released in conjunction with his Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction in 2004. His most recent studio album is 2021's <i>Downhill from Everywhere</i>, the follow-up to 2014's <i>Standing in the Breach</i>, which included the first fully realized version of his song ""The Birds of St. Marks"", a song he had written at age 18. In 2015, <i>Rolling Stone</i> ranked him as 37th in its list of the ""100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time"".</p>"

<p><b>Amethyst Amelia Kelly</b> (born 7 June 1990), known professionally as <b>Iggy Azalea</b> (<span></span>), is an Australian rapper, songwriter, and model. At the age of 16, Azalea moved from Australia to the United States in order to pursue a career in music. Azalea earned public recognition after releasing the music videos for her songs ""Pussy"" and ""Two Times"" on YouTube, both of which gained rapid popularity. Azalea shortly after released her debut mixtape, <i>Ignorant Art</i> (2011), and subsequently signed a recording contract with American rapper T.I.'s Grand Hustle label.
</p><p>Azalea's debut studio album, <i>The New Classic</i> (2014), peaked among the top five on several charts worldwide, but received mixed reviews from within the industry. The album eventually topped the <i>Billboard</i> Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums, making Azalea the first non-American female rapper to reach the top of the chart. <i>The New Classic</i> was preceded by Azalea's debut single ""Work"" and chart-topping single ""Fancy"" (featuring Charli XCX), which hit the U.S. <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. Azalea was featured on Ariana Grande's 2014 single ""Problem"", which peaked at number two behind ""Fancy"". With these hits, Azalea became the second musical act (behind The Beatles) act to rank at number one and two simultaneously on the Hot 100 with their debut appearances on the chart. In addition, she achieved three top ten hits simultaneously on the Hot 100 with the aforementioned songs and the album's fifth single, ""Black Widow"" (featuring Rita Ora), which debuted later that year.</p><p>After her debut album, Azalea released a slew of singles to build anticipation for her intended second album, <i>Digital Distortion.</i> However, a series of conflicts with her label, as well as personal conflicts, resulted in the project being cancelled. Consequently, Azalea switched labels, releasing the EP <i>Survive the Summer</i> (2018) under Island Records. Further disagreements led to Azalea becoming an independent artist and creating her own label, Bad Dreams, through a distribution deal with Empire. Her second album, <i>In My Defense</i>, was released in 2019, followed by another EP, <i>Wicked Lips</i>, that same year, and a third studio album, <i>The End of an Era</i>, in 2021.
</p><p>Azalea's accolades include two American Music Awards, three Billboard Music Awards, an MTV Video Music Award, a People's Choice Award, four Teen Choice Awards and four Grammy Award nominations. Azalea's official YouTube channel has accumulated 3.4 billion views, with 15 music videos receiving over 100 million views on Vevo.

<link rel=""mw-deduplicated-inline-style"" href=""mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096"">
<p><b>Franz Liszt</b> (22 October 1811 – 31 July 1886) was a Hungarian composer, pianist and teacher of the Romantic period. With a diverse body of work spanning more than six decades, he is considered to be one of the most prolific and influential composers of his era and remains one of the most popular composers in modern concert piano repertoire.</p><p>Liszt first gained renown during the early nineteenth century for his virtuoso skill as a pianist. Regarded as one of the greatest pianists of all time, he toured Europe during the 1830s and 1840s, often playing for charity. In these years, Liszt developed a reputation for his powerful performances as well as his physical attractiveness. In what has now been dubbed ""Lisztomania"", he rose to a degree of stardom and popularity among the public not experienced by the virtuosos who preceded him. Whereas earlier performers mostly served the upper class, Liszt attracted a more general audience. During this period and into his later life, Liszt was a friend, musical promoter and benefactor to many composers of his time, including Frédéric Chopin, Charles-Valentin Alkan, Richard Wagner, Hector Berlioz, Robert Schumann, Clara Schumann, Camille Saint-Saëns, Edvard Grieg, Ole Bull, Joachim Raff, Mikhail Glinka, and Alexander Borodin.</p><p>Liszt was one of the most prominent representatives of the New German School (German: <i lang=""de"">Neudeutsche Schule</i>). He left behind an extensive and diverse body of work that influenced his forward-looking contemporaries and anticipated 20th-century ideas and trends. Among Liszt's musical contributions were the symphonic poem, developing thematic transformation as part of his experiments in musical form, and radical innovations in harmony. Liszt has also been regarded as a forefather of Impressionism in music, with his <i>Années de pèlerinage</i>, often regarded as his masterwork, featuring many impressionistic qualities. In a radical departure from his earlier compositional styles, many of Liszt's later works also feature experiments in atonality, foreshadowing the serialist movement of the 20th century.

<p><b>Charles Mingus Jr.</b> (April 22, 1922 – January 5, 1979) was an American jazz upright bassist, pianist, composer, bandleader, and author. A major proponent of collective improvisation, he is considered to be one of the greatest jazz musicians and composers in history, with a career spanning three decades and collaborations with other jazz musicians such as Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, and Herbie Hancock. Mingus's work ranged from advanced bebop and avant-garde jazz with small and midsize ensembles – pioneering the post-bop style on seminal recordings like <i>Pithecanthropus Erectus</i> (1956) and <i>Mingus Ah Um</i> (1959) – to progressive big band experiments such as <i>The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady</i> (1963).
</p><p>Mingus's compositions continue to be played by contemporary musicians ranging from the repertory bands Mingus Big Band, Mingus Dynasty, and Mingus Orchestra, to the high school students who play the charts and compete in the Charles Mingus High School Competition. In 1993, the Library of Congress acquired Mingus's collected papers—including scores, sound recordings, correspondence and photos—in what they described as ""the most important acquisition of a manuscript collection relating to jazz in the Library's history"".</p>"

He is best known for creating comedy songs that make light of pop culture and often parody specific songs by contemporary musicians. He also performs original songs that are style pastiches of the work of other acts, as well as polka medleys of several popular songs, most of which feature his trademark accordion.
</p><p>Since having a comedy song aired on <i>The Dr. Demento Radio Show</i> in 1976 at age 16, Yankovic has sold more than 12 million albums (as of 2015), recorded more than 150 parodies and original songs, and performed more than 1,000 live shows. His work has earned him five Grammy Awards and a further 11 nominations, four gold records, and six platinum records in the U.S. His first top ten <i>Billboard</i> album (<i>Straight Outta Lynwood</i>) and single (""White &amp; Nerdy"") were both released in 2006, nearly three decades into his career. His latest album, <i>Mandatory Fun</i> (2014), became his first number-one album during its debut week.
</p><p>Yankovic's success comes in part from his effective use of music videos to further parody pop culture, the song's original artist, and the original music videos themselves, scene-for-scene in some cases. He directed later videos himself and went on to direct for other artists, including Ben Folds, Hanson, the Black Crowes, and the Presidents of the United States of America. With the decline of music television and the onset of social media, he used YouTube and other video sites to publish his videos; this strategy helped to boost sales of his later albums. Yankovic has stated that he may forgo traditional albums in favor of timely releases of singles from the 2010s onwards.
</p><p>In addition to recording his albums, Yankovic wrote and starred in the film <i>UHF</i> (1989) and the television series <i>The Weird Al Show</i> (1997).

<p><b>Bobby Darin</b> (born <b>Walden Robert Cassotto</b>; May 14, 1936 – December 20, 1973) was an American musician and actor. He performed jazz, pop, rock and roll, folk, swing, and country music.
</p><p>He started his career as a songwriter for Connie Francis. He recorded his first million-selling single, ""Splish Splash"", in 1958. That was followed by ""Dream Lover"", ""Mack the Knife"", and ""Beyond the Sea"", which brought him worldwide fame. In 1962, he won a Golden Globe Award for his first film, <i>Come September</i>, co-starring his first wife, actress Sandra Dee.
</p><p>During the 1960s, he became more politically active and worked on Robert F. Kennedy's Democratic presidential campaign. He was present at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles at the time of Robert Kennedy's assassination in June 1968. During the same year, he discovered the woman who had raised him was his grandmother, not his mother as he thought, and learned that the woman he thought was his sister was actually his mother. Those events deeply affected Darin and sent him into a long period of seclusion.</p><p>Although he made a successful comeback (in television) in the early 1970s, his health was beginning to fail following bouts of rheumatic fever in childhood. The knowledge of his vulnerability had always spurred him on to use his musical talent while still young. He died at the age of 37 after a heart operation in Los Angeles in 1973.</p>"
