</p>
<p><b>Marshall Bruce Mathers III</b> (born October 17, 1972), known professionally as <b>Eminem</b> (<span></span>; often stylized as <b>EMINƎM</b>), is an American rapper and record producer. He is credited with popularizing hip hop in middle America and is critically acclaimed as one of the greatest rappers of all time. Eminem's global success and acclaimed works are widely regarded as having broken racial barriers for the acceptance of white rappers in popular music. While much of his transgressive work during the late 1990s and early 2000s made him widely controversial, he came to be a representation of popular angst of the American underclass and has been cited as an influence for many artists of various genres.
</p><p>After the release of his debut album <i>Infinite</i> (1996) and the extended play <i>Slim Shady EP</i> (1997), Eminem signed with Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment and subsequently achieved mainstream popularity in 1999 with <i>The Slim Shady LP</i>. His next two releases, <i>The Marshall Mathers LP</i> (2000) and <i>The Eminem Show</i> (2002), were worldwide successes and were both nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. After the release of his next album, <i>Encore</i> (2004), Eminem went on hiatus in 2005, largely due to a prescription drug addiction. He returned to the music industry four years later with the release of <i>Relapse</i> (2009) and <i>Recovery</i> was released the following year. <i>Recovery</i> was the best-selling album worldwide of 2010, making it Eminem's second album, after <i>The Eminem Show</i> in 2002, to be the best-selling album of the year worldwide. In the following years, he released the US number one albums <i>The Marshall Mathers LP 2</i> (2013), <i>Revival</i> (2017), <i>Kamikaze</i> (2018) and <i>Music to Be Murdered By</i> (2020).
</p><p>Eminem made his debut in the film industry with the musical drama film <i>8 Mile</i> (2002), playing a fictionalized version of himself, and his track ""Lose Yourself"" from its soundtrack won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, making him the first hip hop artist ever to win the award. Eminem has made cameo appearances in the films <i>The Wash</i> (2001), <i>Funny People</i> (2009) and <i>The Interview</i> (2014) and the television series <i>Entourage</i> (2010). He has also developed other ventures, including Shady Records, a joint venture with manager Paul Rosenberg, which helped launch the careers of artists such as 50 Cent, D12 and Obie Trice, among others. He has also established his own channel, Shade 45, on Sirius XM Radio.
</p><p>In addition to his solo career, Eminem was a member of the hip hop group D12. He is also known for collaborations with fellow Detroit-based rapper Royce da 5'9""; the two are collectively known as Bad Meets Evil.
</p><p>Eminem is among the best-selling music artists of all time, with estimated worldwide sales of over 220 million records. He was the best-selling music artist in the United States of the 2000s and the best-selling male music artist in the United States of the 2010s, third overall. <i>Billboard</i> named him the ""Artist of the Decade (2000–2009)"". He has had ten number-one albums on the <i>Billboard</i> 200—which all consecutively debuted at number one on the chart, making him the first artist to achieve this—and five number-one singles on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. <i>The Marshall Mathers LP</i>, <i>The Eminem Show</i>, <i>Curtain Call: The Hits</i> (2005), ""Lose Yourself"", ""Love the Way You Lie"" and ""Not Afraid"" have all been certified Diamond or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). <i>Rolling Stone</i> has included him in its lists of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time and the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time. He has won numerous awards, including 15 Grammy Awards, eight American Music Awards, 17 <i>Billboard</i> Music Awards, an Academy Award, a Primetime Emmy Award and an MTV Europe Music Global Icon Award. In November 2022, Eminem was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.</p>"

Intent on pursuing a solo career as a rapper, he released his debut studio album, <i>The College Dropout</i> (2004), to critical and commercial success. He founded the record label GOOD Music later that year. West explored diverse musical elements like orchestras, synthesizers, and autotune on the albums <i>Late Registration</i> (2005), <i>Graduation</i> (2007), and <i>808s &amp; Heartbreak</i> (2008).

As a fashion designer, he has collaborated with Nike, Louis Vuitton, Gap, and A.P.C. on clothing and footwear and led the Yeezy collaboration with Adidas. He is also the founder and head of the creative content company Donda.
</p><p>West's outspoken views have received significant media coverage; he has been a frequent source of controversy due to his conduct on social media and at awards shows and public settings, as well as his comments on the music and fashion industries, U.S. politics, race, and slavery. His Christian faith, high-profile marriage to Kim Kardashian, and mental health have also been topics of media attention. In 2020, West launched an unsuccessful independent presidential campaign that primarily advocated for a consistent life ethic. In 2022, he was widely condemned and lost many sponsors and partnerships—including his collaborations with Adidas, Gap, and Balenciaga—after making a series of antisemitic statements. In November 2022, he announced his 2024 presidential campaign, appearing publicly with Nick Fuentes, a white supremacist. He later publicly praised Adolf Hitler, denied the Holocaust, and identified as a Nazi.</p>"

</p>
<p><b>Michael Joseph Jackson</b> (August 29, 1958 – June 25, 2009) was an American singer, songwriter, dancer, and philanthropist. Dubbed the ""King of Pop"", he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century. Over a four-decade career, his contributions to music, dance, and fashion, along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture. Jackson influenced artists across many music genres; through stage and video performances, he popularized complicated dance moves such as the moonwalk, to which he gave the name, as well as the robot. He is the most awarded recording artist in pop music history.</p><p>The eighth child of the Jackson family, Jackson made his public debut in 1964 with his older brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon as a member of the Jackson 5 (later known as the Jacksons). Jackson began his solo career in 1971 while at Motown Records. He became a solo star with his 1979 album <i>Off the Wall</i>. His music videos, including those for ""Beat It"", ""Billie Jean"", and ""Thriller"" from his 1982 album <i>Thriller</i>, are credited with breaking racial barriers and transforming the medium into an artform and promotional tool. He helped propel the success of MTV and continued to innovate with videos for the albums <i>Bad</i> (1987), <i>Dangerous</i> (1991), <i>HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I</i> (1995), and <i>Invincible</i> (2001). <i>Thriller</i> became the best-selling album of all time, while <i>Bad</i> was the first album to produce five US <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 number-one singles.</p><p>From the late 1980s, Jackson became a figure of controversy and speculation due to his changing appearance, relationships, behavior, and lifestyle. In 1993, he was accused of sexually abusing the child of a family friend. The lawsuit was settled out of civil court; Jackson was not indicted due to lack of evidence. In 2005, he was tried and acquitted of further child sexual abuse allegations and several other charges. The FBI found no evidence of criminal conduct by Jackson in either case. In 2009, while he was preparing for a series of comeback concerts, This Is It, Jackson died from an overdose of propofol administered by his personal physician, Conrad Murray, who was convicted in 2011 of involuntary manslaughter. His death triggered reactions around the world, creating unprecedented surges of Internet traffic and a spike in sales of his music. A televised memorial service for Jackson, held at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, was viewed by an estimated over 2.5 billion people globally.
</p><p>Jackson is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with estimated sales of over 400<span> </span>million records worldwide. He had 13 <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 number-one singles (third highest of any artist in the Hot 100 era) and was the first artist to have a top-ten single in the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 in five different decades. He is regarded by the RIAA as the highest-selling individual music artist of all time worldwide. His honors include 15 Grammy Awards, 6 Brit Awards, a Golden Globe Award, and 39 Guinness World Records, including the ""Most Successful Entertainer of All Time"".

<p><b>David Robert Jones</b> (8 January 1947 – 10 January 2016), known professionally as <b>David Bowie</b> (<span></span> <i title=""English pronunciation respelling""><span>BOH</span>-ee</i>), was an English singer-songwriter and actor. A leading figure in the music industry, he is regarded as one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century. Bowie was acclaimed by critics and musicians, particularly for his innovative work during the 1970s. His career was marked by reinvention and visual presentation, and his music and stagecraft had a significant impact on popular music.
</p><p>Bowie developed an interest in music from an early age. He studied art, music and design before embarking on a professional career as a musician in 1963. ""Space Oddity"", released in 1969, was his first top-five entry on the UK Singles Chart. After a period of experimentation, he re-emerged in 1972 during the glam rock era with his flamboyant and androgynous alter ego Ziggy Stardust. The character was spearheaded by the success of Bowie's single ""Starman"" and album <i>The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars</i>, which won him widespread popularity. In 1975, Bowie's style shifted towards a sound he characterised as ""plastic soul"", initially alienating many of his UK fans but garnering him his first major US crossover success with the number-one single ""Fame"" and the album <i>Young Americans</i>. In 1976, Bowie starred in the cult film <i>The Man Who Fell to Earth</i> and released <i>Station to Station</i>. In 1977, he again changed direction with the electronic-inflected album <i>Low</i>, the first of three collaborations with Brian Eno that came to be known as the ""Berlin Trilogy"". <i>""Heroes""</i> (1977) and <i>Lodger</i> (1979) followed; each album reached the UK top five and received lasting critical praise.
</p><p>After uneven commercial success in the late 1970s, Bowie had three number-one hits: the 1980 single ""Ashes to Ashes"", its album <i>Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)</i>, and ""Under Pressure"" (a 1981 collaboration with Queen). He achieved massive commercial success in the 1980s starting with <i>Let's Dance</i> (1983). Between 1988 and 1992, he fronted the hard rock band Tin Machine before resuming his solo career in 1993. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Bowie continued to experiment with musical styles, including industrial and jungle. He also continued acting; his roles included Major Jack Celliers in <i>Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence</i> (1983), Jareth the Goblin King in <i>Labyrinth</i> (1986), Pontius Pilate in <i>The Last Temptation of Christ</i> (1988), and Nikola Tesla in <i>The Prestige</i> (2006), among other film and television appearances and cameos. He stopped touring after 2004 and his last live performance was at a charity event in 2006. In 2013, Bowie returned from a decade-long recording hiatus with <i>The Next Day</i>. He remained musically active until his death from liver cancer at his home in New York City. He died two days after both his 69th birthday and the release of his final album, <i>Blackstar</i> (2016).
</p><p>During his lifetime, his record sales, estimated at over 100 million records worldwide, made him one of the best-selling musicians of all time. In the UK, he was awarded ten platinum, eleven gold and eight silver album certifications, and released 11 number-one albums. In the US, he received five platinum and nine gold certifications. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996. <i>Rolling Stone</i> ranked him among the greatest artists in history. As of 2022, Bowie was the best-selling vinyl artist of the 21st century.

</p>
<p><b>John R. Cash</b> (born <b>J. R. Cash</b>; February 26, 1932 – September 12, 2003) was an American country singer-songwriter. Much of Cash's music contained themes of sorrow, moral tribulation, and redemption, especially in the later stages of his career. He was known for his deep, calm bass-baritone voice, the distinctive sound of his Tennessee Three backing band characterized by train-like chugging guitar rhythms, a rebelliousness coupled with an increasingly somber and humble demeanor, free prison concerts, and a trademark all-black stage wardrobe, which earned him the nickname the ""<b>Man in Black</b>"".</p><p>Born to poor cotton farmers in Kingsland, Arkansas, Cash rose to fame during the mid-1950s in the burgeoning rockabilly scene in Memphis, Tennessee, after four years in the Air Force. He traditionally began his concerts by simply introducing himself, ""Hello, I'm Johnny Cash"", followed by ""Folsom Prison Blues"", one of his signature songs. His other signature songs include ""I Walk the Line"", ""Ring of Fire"", ""Get Rhythm"", and ""Man in Black"". He also recorded humorous numbers like ""One Piece at a Time"" and ""A Boy Named Sue"", a duet with his future wife June called ""Jackson"" (followed by many further duets after their wedding), and railroad songs such as ""Hey, Porter"", ""Orange Blossom Special"", and ""Rock Island Line"". During the last stage of his career, he covered songs by contemporary rock artists; among his most notable covers were ""Hurt"" by Nine Inch Nails, ""Rusty Cage"" by Soundgarden, and ""Personal Jesus"" by Depeche Mode.
</p><p>Cash is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 90 million records worldwide. His genre-spanning music embraced country, rock and roll, rockabilly, blues, folk, and gospel sounds. This crossover appeal earned him the rare honor of being inducted into the Country Music, Rock and Roll, and Gospel Music Halls of Fame. His music career was dramatized in the 2005 biopic <i>Walk the Line</i>, in which Cash was portrayed by American film actor Joaquin Phoenix.

</p>

<p><b>James Marshall</b> ""<b>Jimi</b>"" <b>Hendrix</b> (born <b>Johnny Allen Hendrix</b>; November 27, 1942 – September 18, 1970) was an American guitarist, singer and songwriter. Although his mainstream career spanned only four years, he is widely regarded as one of the most influential electric guitarists in the history of popular music, and one of the most celebrated musicians of the 20th century. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame describes him as ""arguably the greatest instrumentalist in the history of rock music.""</p><p>Born in Seattle, Washington, Hendrix began playing guitar at the age of 15. In 1961, he enlisted in the US Army, but was discharged the following year. Soon afterward, he moved to Clarksville then Nashville, Tennessee, and began playing gigs on the chitlin' circuit, earning a place in the Isley Brothers' backing band and later with Little Richard, with whom he continued to work through mid-1965. He then played with Curtis Knight and the Squires before moving to England in late 1966 after bassist Chas Chandler of the Animals became his manager. Within months, Hendrix had earned three UK top ten hits with the Jimi Hendrix Experience: ""Hey Joe"", ""Purple Haze"", and ""The Wind Cries Mary"". He achieved fame in the US after his performance at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967, and in 1968 his third and final studio album, <i>Electric Ladyland</i>, reached number one in the US. The double LP was Hendrix's most commercially successful release and his first and only number one album. The world's highest-paid performer, he headlined the Woodstock Festival in 1969 and the Isle of Wight Festival in 1970 before his accidental death in London from barbiturate-related asphyxia on September 18, 1970.
</p><p>Hendrix was inspired by American rock and roll and electric blues. He favored overdriven amplifiers with high volume and gain, and was instrumental in popularizing the previously undesirable sounds caused by guitar amplifier feedback. He was also one of the first guitarists to make extensive use of tone-altering effects units in mainstream rock, such as fuzz distortion, Octavia, wah-wah, and Uni-Vibe. He was the first musician to use stereophonic phasing effects in recordings. Holly George-Warren of <i>Rolling Stone</i> commented: ""Hendrix pioneered the use of the instrument as an electronic sound source. Players before him had experimented with feedback and distortion, but Hendrix turned those effects and others into a controlled, fluid vocabulary every bit as personal as the blues with which he began.""</p><p>Hendrix was the recipient of several music awards during his lifetime and posthumously. In 1967, readers of <i>Melody Maker</i> voted him the Pop Musician of the Year and in 1968, <i>Billboard</i> named him the Artist of the Year and <i>Rolling Stone</i> declared him the Performer of the Year. <i>Disc and Music Echo</i> honored him with the World Top Musician of 1969 and in 1970, <i>Guitar Player</i> named him the Rock Guitarist of the Year. The Jimi Hendrix Experience was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992 and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2005. <i>Rolling Stone</i> ranked the band's three studio albums, <i>Are You Experienced</i>, <i>Axis: Bold as Love</i>, and <i>Electric Ladyland</i>, among the 100 greatest albums of all time, and they ranked Hendrix as the greatest guitarist and the sixth-greatest artist of all time.

<p><b>Scott Ramon Seguro Mescudi</b> (born January 30, 1984), also known by his stage name <b>Kid Cudi</b> (<span></span> <i title=""English pronunciation respelling""><span>KUDD</span>-ee</i>), is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, record producer, actor and fashion designer. Born and raised in Cleveland, Ohio, Cudi would move to New York City in pursuit of a musical career, where he first gained major recognition following the release of his debut single ""Day 'n' Nite"", which he initially self-published on his MySpace page. The song went on to become a worldwide hit and served as the catalyst for Cudi to team with American record producers Plain Pat and Emile Haynie, to record his first official full-length project, a mixtape titled <i>A Kid Named Cudi</i> (2008). The mixtape helped Cudi rise to prominence and establish a fan base, and it caught the attention of high-profile musician Kanye West, who subsequently signed Cudi to his GOOD Music label imprint by late 2008.
</p><p>Cudi's commercial debut single was later remastered and featured on his seminal debut album, <i>Man on the Moon: The End of Day</i> (2009), which was certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album also included the singles ""Make Her Say"" (featuring Kanye West and Common) and ""Pursuit of Happiness"" (featuring MGMT and Ratatat), the latter of which achieved diamond status (10x platinum) by the RIAA. In 2010, Cudi released his second album, <i>Man on the Moon II: The Legend of Mr. Rager</i>, which also attained platinum status and features the singles ""Erase Me"" (featuring Kanye West) and ""Mr. Rager"". Later that year he formed WZRD, a rock band, with his long-time collaborator Dot da Genius. Their eponymous debut album (2012) debuted at number one on the <i>Billboard</i> Top Rock Albums chart.</p><p>Cudi would go on to release the self-produced solo album <i>Indicud</i> (2013), which was certified gold by the RIAA and spawned the platinum-selling single ""Just What I Am"" (featuring King Chip). He would continue to produce the bulk of his own records, including the avant-garde music albums <i>Satellite Flight: The Journey to Mother Moon</i> (2014) and <i>Speedin' Bullet 2 Heaven</i> (2015), the latter of which was led by the grunge-inspired single ""Confused!"". In 2016, the release of his sixth solo album <i>Passion, Pain &amp; Demon Slayin'</i>, was supported by the lead single ""Surfin'"" (featuring Pharrell Williams). Cudi's joint album with Kanye West, under the eponymous name <i>Kids See Ghosts</i> (2018), was met with widespread critical acclaim. In April 2020, Cudi earned his first number-one song on the US <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 chart with ""The Scotts"", alongside fellow American rapper Travis Scott. His seventh album, <i>Man on the Moon III: The Chosen</i> (2020), was highly acclaimed and a commercial success, having been certified gold by the RIAA. Cudi issued his eighth album <i>Entergalactic</i> (2022), coinciding with the release of a adult animated special of the same name inspired by the album, which was critically praised.
</p><p>After signing to GOOD Music, Cudi has since gone on to launch his own vanity labels, the now-dissolved Dream On and current label imprint Wicked Awesome Records. Cudi also ventured into acting in 2010, when he was cast in the HBO series <i>How to Make It in America</i>. He has since appeared in several feature films, including <i>Goodbye World</i> (2013), <i>Need for Speed</i> (2014), <i>Entourage</i> (2015), <i>Bill &amp; Ted Face the Music</i> (2020), <i>Don't Look Up</i> (2021), and <i>X</i> (2022). In addition, he has made appearances on television shows such as <i>One Tree Hill</i>, <i>The Cleveland Show</i>, <i>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</i>, and <i>Westworld</i>. In 2015, he was the bandleader on the IFC series <i>Comedy Bang! Bang!</i> and in 2020 was added as a cast member for the HBO mini-series <i>We Are Who We Are</i>. In 2020, he launched Mad Solar, a production company for film and television, which produced a documentary titled <i>A Man Named Scott</i> (2021), storying Cudi's music career. Cudi is also founder, creator, and director of the clothing line ""MOTR"", which he launched in 2022.
</p><p>Kid Cudi has been widely recognized as an influence on several contemporary hip hop and alternative acts. His lyrics are often autobiographical and describe his childhood hardships of depression, loneliness and alienation, his struggle with alcohol and drugs into adulthood, and themes of spirituality, heartbreak, dissipation and celebration. The majority of his impact stems from his ability to display vulnerability and address bouts with mental health. He is also noted for his experimental nature, combining elements of psychedelia, R&amp;B, electronica, synthpop, punk and indie rock, in his music. Cudi has sold over 22 million certified records in the United States and has won two Grammy Awards from five nominations. He has worked with numerous prominent artists spanning several different genres in the music industry, namely Jay-Z, Eminem, Kendrick Lamar, David Guetta, Steve Aoki, MGMT, Mary J. Blige, Shakira, Ariana Grande and Michael Bolton, among others.</p>"

For the enduring popularity of her holiday music, particularly the 1994 song ""All I Want for Christmas Is You"", she has also been dubbed the ""Queen of Christmas"". Carey rose to fame in 1990 with her debut album <i>Mariah Carey</i>. She was the first artist to have their first five singles reach number one on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100, from ""Vision of Love"" to ""Emotions"".
</p><p>Carey's self-titled debut album was released under the guidance of Columbia Records executive Tommy Mottola, who married her three years later. She gained further worldwide success with the albums <i>Music Box</i> (1993)  and <i>Daydream</i> (1995).

</p><p>Following Carey's highly publicized physical and emotional breakdown and the failure of the film <i>Glitter</i> (2001) and its soundtrack, Virgin bought out her contract and she signed with Island Records the following year. After a comparatively unsuccessful period, Carey returned to the top of the charts with <i>The Emancipation of Mimi</i> (2005), which became the best-selling album in the US and the world's second best-selling album of 2005. Its second single, ""We Belong Together"", topped the US <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 decade-end chart (2000s).

</p><p>Carey is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with over 220 million records sold worldwide. She was ranked as the fifth greatest singer of all time by <i>Rolling Stone</i> in 2023 and placed second in VH1's list of the 100 Greatest Women in Music.

In 2008, she was named one of Time's annual 100 most influential artists and entertainers in the world. <i>Billboard</i> named her the ""top-charting female solo artist"", based on both album and song chart success in 2019. Carey has won 5 Grammy Awards, 19 World Music Awards, 10 American Music Awards, 15 <i>Billboard</i> Music Awards and eight Guinness World Records.
