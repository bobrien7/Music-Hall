The castaways must provide food, water, fire, and shelter for themselves. The contestants compete in various challenges for rewards and immunity from elimination.

The final castaway remaining is awarded the title of ""Sole Survivor"" and the grand prize of A$500,000.

</p>
<p><b>Pavement</b> is an American indie rock band that formed in Stockton, California, in 1989. For most of their career, the group consisted of Stephen Malkmus (vocals and guitar), Scott Kannberg (guitar and vocals), Mark Ibold (bass), Steve West (drums) and Bob Nastanovich (percussion and vocals). Initially conceived as a recording project, the band at first avoided press or live performances, while attracting considerable underground attention with their early releases. Gradually evolving into a more polished band, Pavement recorded five full-length albums and ten EPs over the course of their decade-long career, though they disbanded with some acrimony in 1999 as the members moved on to other projects. In 2010, they undertook a well-received reunion tour, with another international tour currently ongoing in 2022 and 2023.</p><p>Though only briefly attracting mainstream attention with the single ""Cut Your Hair"" in 1994, Pavement was a successful indie rock band. Rather than signing with a major label as many of their 1980s forebears had done, they remained signed to independent labels throughout their career, including Flying Nun and Matador. They have often been described as one of the most influential bands to emerge from the American underground in the '90s. Some prominent music critics, such as Robert Christgau and Stephen Thomas Erlewine, called them the best band of the 1990s. They have achieved a cult following.</p>"

Cretu had released several solo records, collaborated with various artists, and produced albums for his then-wife, German pop singer Sandra, before he conceived the idea of a new-age, worldbeat project. He recorded the first Enigma studio album, <i>MCMXC a.D.</i> (1990), with contributions from David Fairstein and Frank Peterson. The album remains Enigma's most successful, helped by the international hit single ""Sadeness (Part I)"", which sold twelve million units alone. According to Cretu, the inspiration for the creation of the project came from his desire to make a kind of music that did not obey ""the old rules and habits"" and presented a new form of artistic expression with mystic and experimental components.</p><p>Enigma followed <i>MCMXC a.D.</i> with a series of albums that involved several musicians and producers working with Cretu. The first was <i>The Cross of Changes</i> (1993), which incorporated tribal and ethnic influences and sold over eight million copies worldwide, followed by <i>Le Roi Est Mort, Vive Le Roi!</i> (1996), which blended the Gregorian chants reminiscent of the first album with the strong intercultural soundscapes present in the second. Enigma's fourth album <i>The Screen Behind the Mirror</i> (2000) started a slight departure from the previous world music themes towards a heavier electronic atmosphere. This evolution culminated with <i>Voyageur</i> (2003), its fifth and more pop-based album, and <i>A Posteriori</i> (2006), a work inspired by the future collision between the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies, with distinct operatic tones and an electronic spectrum closer to <i>Voyageur</i> than the earlier releases. <i>Seven Lives Many Faces</i> (2008) followed and contained a mixture of classical and modern elements ranging from ethnic chants to rap and dubstep influences. Its eighth album, <i>The Fall of a Rebel Angel</i>, was released in November 2016.</p><p>Enigma has sold over 8.5 million RIAA-certified albums in the US and an estimated 70 million worldwide with over 100 gold and platinum certifications.

With a population of 2,746,388 in the 2020 census, it is also the most populous city in the Midwest. As the seat of Cook County (the second-most populous U.S. county), the city is the center of the Chicago metropolitan area, one of the largest in the world.
</p><p>On the shore of Lake Michigan, Chicago was incorporated as a city in 1837 near a portage between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River watershed. It grew rapidly in the mid-19th century; by 1860, Chicago was the youngest U.S. city to exceed a population of 100,000. The Great Chicago Fire in 1871 destroyed several square miles and left more than 100,000 homeless, but Chicago's population continued to grow to 503,000 by 1880 and then doubled to more than a million within the decade. The construction boom accelerated population growth throughout the following decades, and by 1900, less than 30 years after the fire, Chicago was the fifth-largest city in the world. Chicago made noted contributions to urban planning and zoning standards, including new construction styles (such as Chicago School architecture, the development of the City Beautiful Movement, and the steel-framed skyscraper).</p><p>Chicago is an international hub for finance, culture, commerce, industry, education, technology, telecommunications, and transportation. It is the site of the creation of the first standardized futures contracts, issued by the Chicago Board of Trade, which today is part of the largest and most diverse derivatives market in the world, generating 20% of all volume in commodities and financial futures alone. O'Hare International Airport is routinely ranked among the world's top six busiest airports according to tracked data by the Airports Council International. The region also has the largest number of federal highways and is the nation's railroad hub. The Chicago area has one of the highest gross domestic products (GDP) in the world, generating $689 billion in 2018. The economy of Chicago is diverse, with no single industry employing more than 14% of the workforce. It is home to several <i>Fortune</i> 500 companies, including Archer-Daniels-Midland, Conagra Brands, Exelon, JLL, Kraft Heinz, McDonald's, Mondelez International, Motorola Solutions, Sears, and United Airlines Holdings.</p><p>Chicago's 58 million tourist visitors in 2018 set a new record. Landmarks in the city include Millennium Park, Navy Pier, the Magnificent Mile, Art Institute of Chicago, Museum Campus, Willis (Sears) Tower, Grant Park, Museum of Science and Industry, and Lincoln Park Zoo. Chicago is also home to the Barack Obama Presidential Center being built in Hyde Park on the city's South Side. Chicago's culture includes the visual arts, literature, film, theater, comedy (especially improvisational comedy), food, dance (including modern dance and jazz troupes and the Joffrey Ballet), and music (particularly jazz, blues, soul, hip-hop, gospel, and electronic dance music, including house music). Chicago is also the location of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and the Lyric Opera of Chicago. Of the area's colleges and universities, the University of Chicago, Northwestern University, and the University of Illinois Chicago are classified as ""highest research"" doctoral universities. Chicago has professional sports teams in each of the major professional leagues, including two Major League Baseball teams.

It appears at John 1:29, where John the Baptist sees Jesus and exclaims, ""Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world."" It appears again in John 1:36.
</p><p>Christian doctrine holds that a divine Jesus chose to suffer crucifixion at Calvary as a sign of his full obedience to the will of his divine Father, as an ""agent and servant of God"" in carrying away the sins of the world. In Christian theology the <i>Lamb of God</i> is viewed as both foundational and integral to the message of Christianity.</p><p>A lion-like lamb that rises to deliver victory after being slain appears several times in the Book of Revelation. It is also referred to in Pauline writings; 1 Corinthians 5:7 suggests that Saint Paul intends to refer to the death of Jesus, who is the Paschal Lamb, using the theme found in Johannine writings. In Genesis 22, the binding of Isaac foretells the Gospel of Jesus Christ, when Isaac asked his father Abraham ""where is the lamb for the burnt offering"" to which Abraham responded ""God himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son."" (Genesis 22:7-8).  However, it was a Ram (not a Lamb) that was ultimately sacrificed in Isaac's place, and the Ram was caught in a thicket (i.e. thornbush). (Genesis 22:13). The lamb metaphor is also in line with Psalm 23, which depicts God as a shepherd leading his flock (mankind).
</p><p>The Lamb of God title is widely used in Christian prayers. The Latin version, Agnus Dei, and translations are a standard part of the Catholic Mass, as well as the classical Western Liturgies of the Anglican and Lutheran churches. It is also used in liturgy and as a form of contemplative prayer. The <span title=""Latin-language text""><i lang=""la"">Agnus Dei</i></span> also forms a part of the musical setting for the Mass.
</p><p>As a visual motif the lamb has been most often represented since the Middle Ages as a standing haloed lamb with a foreleg cocked ""holding"" a pennant with a red cross on a white ground, though many other ways of representing it have been used.

Initially playing a raw, primitive style of rock and roll, the band sold few records in their original incarnation and gained a reputation for their confrontational performances, which often involved acts of self-mutilation by Iggy Pop.</p><p>After releasing two albums – <i>The Stooges</i> (1969) and <i>Fun House</i> (1970) – the group disbanded briefly, and reformed with an altered lineup (with Ron Asheton replacing Dave Alexander on bass and James Williamson taking up guitar) to release a third album, <i>Raw Power</i> (1973), before breaking up again in 1974. The band reunited in 2003 with Ron Asheton moving back to guitar and Mike Watt on bass, and the addition of saxophonist Steve Mackay, who had played briefly with the 1973–1974 lineup.

</p>
<p><b>Jane's Addiction</b> is an American rock band from Los Angeles, formed in 1985. The band consists of vocalist Perry Farrell, guitarist Dave Navarro, drummer Stephen Perkins and bassist Eric Avery. Jane's Addiction was one of the first bands from the early 1990s alternative rock movement to gain both mainstream media attention and commercial success in the United States. 
</p><p>Founded by Farrell and Avery, following the disintegration of Farrell's previous band Psi Com, Jane's Addiction's first release was a self-titled live album, <i>Jane's Addiction</i> (1987), which caught the attention of Warner Bros. Records. The band's first two studio albums, <i>Nothing's Shocking</i> (1988) and <i>Ritual de lo Habitual</i> (1990), were released to widespread critical acclaim, and an increasing cult fanbase. As a result, Jane's Addiction became icons of what Farrell dubbed the ""Alternative Nation"". The band's initial farewell tour, in 1991, launched the first Lollapalooza, which has since become a perennial alternative rock festival.
</p><p>In 1997, the band reunited with Flea of the Red Hot Chili Peppers replacing Avery on bass guitar for a one-off tour. In 2001, a second reunion took place, with Martyn LeNoble—and later Chris Chaney—occupying the role of bass guitarist. In 2003, the band released its third studio album, <i>Strays</i>, before dissolving again the following year. In 2008, the band's original line-up reunited and embarked on a world tour. Avery acrimoniously left the band in early 2010, as the group began working on new material. In 2011, the band released its fourth studio album, <i>The Great Escape Artist</i>, with Chaney returning to the band for its recording and subsequent tour.
</p><p>Between the years of 2012 and 2022, the band remained active with occasional tours and performances honouring their legacy. In August 2022, Avery rejoined the band after a twelve-year absence, ahead of a joint tour with the Smashing Pumpkins. Due to ongoing struggles with long COVID, Navarro was replaced by Queens of the Stone Age guitarist Troy Van Leeuwen for the duration of the tour. As the three-piece of Farrell, Avery and Perkins began working on new material, Navarro remained absent from the band. Josh Klinghoffer was announced as his touring replacement in 2023.

<p><b>Declan Patrick MacManus</b>  (born 25 August 1954), known professionally as <b>Elvis Costello</b>, is an English singer-songwriter and record producer. He has won multiple awards in his career, including a Grammy Award in 2020, and has twice been nominated for the Brit Award for Best British Male Artist. In 2003, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2004, <i>Rolling Stone</i> ranked Costello number 80 on its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.</p><p>Costello began his career as part of London's pub rock scene in the early 1970s and later became associated with the first wave of the British punk and new wave movement that emerged in the mid-to-late 1970s. His critically acclaimed debut album <i>My Aim Is True</i> was released in 1977. Shortly after recording it, he formed the Attractions as his backing band. His second album <i>This Year's Model</i> was released in 1978, and was ranked number 11 by <i>Rolling Stone</i> on its list of the best albums from 1967 to 1987. His third album <i>Armed Forces</i> was released in 1979, and features his highest-charting single, ""Oliver's Army"" (number 2 in the UK). His first three albums all appeared on <i>Rolling Stone</i><span>'</span>s list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time in 2003.
</p><p>Costello and the Attractions toured and recorded together for the better part of a decade, though differences between them caused a split by 1986. Much of Costello's work since has been as a solo artist, though reunions with members of the Attractions have been credited to the group over the years. Costello's lyrics employ a wide vocabulary and frequent wordplay. His music has drawn on many diverse genres; one critic described him as a ""pop encyclopaedia"", able to ""reinvent the past in his own image"".  Since 2002, his touring band (featuring a rotating cast of musicians) has been known as the Imposters.
</p><p>Costello has co-written several original songs for films, including ""God Give Me Strength"" from <i>Grace of My Heart</i> (1996, with Burt Bacharach) and ""The Scarlet Tide"" from <i>Cold Mountain</i> (2003, with T-Bone Burnett). For the latter, Elvis was nominated (along with Burnett) for the Academy Award for Best Original Song and the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media.

Thin Lizzy,Dublin,,Thin Lizzy,"<p class=""mw-empty-elt"">


</p>

<p><b>Thin Lizzy</b> is an Irish hard rock band formed in Dublin in 1969. Their music reflects a wide range of influences, including blues, soul music, psychedelic rock and traditional Irish folk music, but is generally classified as hard rock or sometimes heavy metal.
</p><p>Two of the founding members, drummer Brian Downey and bass guitarist, lead vocalist and principal songwriter Phil Lynott, met while still in school. Lynott led the group throughout their recording career of twelve studio albums, writing most of the material. The singles ""Whiskey in the Jar"" (a traditional Irish ballad), ""The Boys Are Back in Town"" and ""Waiting for an Alibi"" were international hits. After Lynott's death in 1986, various incarnations of the band emerged over the years based initially around guitarists Scott Gorham and John Sykes, though Sykes left the band in 2009. Gorham later continued with a new line-up including Downey. In 2012, Gorham and Downey decided against recording new material as Thin Lizzy so a new band, Black Star Riders, was formed to tour and produce new releases, such as their debut album <i>All Hell Breaks Loose</i>. Thin Lizzy have since reunited for occasional concerts.</p><p>Lynott, Thin Lizzy's <i>de facto</i> leader, was composer or co-composer of almost all of the band's songs, and the first black Irishman to achieve commercial success in the field of rock music. Thin Lizzy featured several guitarists throughout their history, with Downey and Lynott as the rhythm section, on the drums and bass guitar. As well as being multiracial, the band drew their early members not only from both sides of the Irish border but also from both the Catholic and Protestant communities during The Troubles.
</p><p><i>Rolling Stone</i> magazine describes the band as distinctly hard rock, ""far apart from the braying mid-70s metal pack"". AllMusic critic John Dougan has written that ""As the band's creative force, Lynott was a more insightful and intelligent writer than many of his ilk, preferring slice-of-life working-class dramas of love and hate influenced by Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen and virtually all of the Irish literary tradition.""</p>"

<p><b>(Achille) Claude Debussy</b> (<small>French: </small><span title=""Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)"" lang=""fr-Latn-fonipa"">[aʃil klod dəbysi]</span>; 22 August 1862 – 25 March 1918) was a French composer. He is sometimes seen as the first Impressionist composer, although he vigorously rejected the term. He was among the most influential composers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
</p><p>Born to a family of modest means and little cultural involvement, Debussy showed enough musical talent to be admitted at the age of ten to France's leading music college, the Conservatoire de Paris. He originally studied the piano, but found his vocation in innovative composition, despite the disapproval of the Conservatoire's conservative professors. He took many years to develop his mature style, and was nearly 40 when he achieved international fame in 1902 with the only opera he completed, <i>Pelléas et Mélisande</i>.
</p><p>Debussy's orchestral works include <i>Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune</i> (1894), <i>Nocturnes</i> (1897–1899) and <i>Images</i> (1905–1912). His music was to a considerable extent a reaction against Wagner and the German musical tradition. He regarded the classical symphony as obsolete and sought an alternative in his ""symphonic sketches"", <i>La mer</i> (1903–1905). His piano works include sets of 24 Préludes and 12 Études. Throughout his career he wrote <i>mélodies</i> based on a wide variety of poetry, including his own. He was greatly influenced by the Symbolist poetic movement of the later 19th century. A small number of works, including the early <i>La Damoiselle élue</i> and the late <i>Le Martyre de saint Sébastien</i> have important parts for chorus. In his final years, he focused on chamber music, completing three of six planned sonatas for different combinations of instruments.
</p><p>With early influences including Russian and Far Eastern music, Debussy developed his own style of harmony and orchestral colouring, derided – and unsuccessfully resisted – by much of the musical establishment of the day. His works have strongly influenced a wide range of composers including Béla Bartók, Olivier Messiaen, George Benjamin, and the jazz pianist and composer Bill Evans. Debussy died from cancer at his home in Paris at the age of 55 after a composing career of a little more than 30 years.
