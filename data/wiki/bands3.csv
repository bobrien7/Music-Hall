</p>
<p><b>House of Pain</b> was an American hip-hop trio that released three albums in the 1990s. The group consisted of DJ Lethal, Danny Boy, and Everlast. The group's name is a reference to the H. G.

Tosca,band,,,Tosca,"<p><i><b>Tosca</b></i> is an opera in three acts by Giacomo Puccini to an Italian libretto by Luigi Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa. It premiered at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome on 14 January 1900. The work, based on Victorien Sardou's 1887 French-language dramatic play, <i>La Tosca</i>, is a melodramatic piece set in Rome in June 1800, with the Kingdom of Naples's control of Rome threatened by Napoleon's invasion of Italy. It contains depictions of torture, murder, and suicide, as well as some of Puccini's best-known lyrical arias.
</p><p>Puccini saw Sardou's play when it was touring Italy in 1889 and, after some vacillation, obtained the rights to turn the work into an opera in 1895. Turning the wordy French play into a succinct Italian opera took four years, during which the composer repeatedly argued with his librettists and publisher. <i>Tosca</i> premiered at a time of unrest in Rome, and its first performance was delayed for a day for fear of disturbances. Despite indifferent reviews from the critics, the opera was an immediate success with the public.
</p><p>Musically, <i>Tosca</i> is structured as a through-composed work, with arias, recitative, choruses and other elements musically woven into a seamless whole. Puccini used Wagnerian leitmotifs to identify characters, objects and ideas. While critics have often dismissed the opera as a facile melodrama with confusions of plot—musicologist Joseph Kerman famously called it a ""shabby little shocker""—the power of its score and the inventiveness of its orchestration have been widely acknowledged. The dramatic force of <i>Tosca</i> and its characters continues to fascinate both performers and audiences, and the work remains one of the most frequently performed operas. Many recordings of the work have been issued, both of studio and live performances.

Barât had worked with Vertigo Records and had previously revealed that his new project was with the label. Didz Hammond announced he was leaving the Cooper Temple Clause to join the band alongside Libertines drummer Gary Powell and guitarist Anthony Rossomando, who had filled in for Doherty following his departure from The Libertines. They played their first shows in October 2005 in Rome, Italy and Paris, France. They announced their split on 1 October 2008 and played their final shows during November that year.</p><p>After adopting the name Dirty Pretty Things, problems arose - a four-piece band from Salisbury had been playing as ""Dirty Pretty Things"" since early January 2005, claiming to have already trademarked the name in the UK. The two groups came to an agreement over the name, and the other band was renamed Mitchell Devastation. An Australian band had been playing under ""Dirty Pretty Things"" since 2003, although it also opted to change it. The name was shared by Barât's club nights in venues throughout London; they assumed the name ""Bright Young Things"" to avoid confusion.

<p>A <b>soundtrack</b> is recorded music accompanying and synchronised to the images of a motion picture, drama, book, television program, radio program, or video game; a commercially released soundtrack album of music as featured in the soundtrack of a film, video, or television presentation; or the physical area of a film that contains the synchronised recorded sound.</p><p>In movie industry terminology usage, a sound track is an audio recording created or used in film production or post-production. Initially, the dialogue, sound effects, and music in a film each has its own separate track, and these are mixed together to make what is called the <i>composite track,</i> which is heard in the film. A <i>dubbing track</i> is often later created when films are dubbed into another language.  This is also known as an M&amp;E (music and effects) track. M&amp;E tracks contain all sound elements minus dialogue, which is then supplied by the foreign distributor in the native language of its territory.
</p><p>Current dictionary entries for soundtrack document soundtrack as a noun, and as a verb. An early attempt at popularizing the term “sound track” was printed in the magazine <i>Photoplay</i> in 1929. A 1992 technical dictionary entry in the <i>Academic Press Dictionary of Science and Technology</i> does not distinguish between the form sound track and soundtrack.</p><p>The contraction <b>soundtrack</b> came into public consciousness with the advent of so-called ""soundtrack albums"" in the late 1940s. First conceived by movie companies as a promotional gimmick for new films, these commercially available recordings were labeled and advertised as ""music from the original motion picture <i>soundtrack</i>"", or ""music from and inspired by the motion picture."" These phrases were soon shortened to just ""original motion picture <i>soundtrack</i>."" More accurately, such recordings are made from a film's <i>music track,</i> because they usually consist of isolated music from a film, not the composite (sound) track with dialogue and sound effects.
</p><p>The abbreviation <b>OST</b> is often used to describe the musical soundtrack on a recorded medium, such as CD, and it stands for <b>original soundtrack</b>; however, it is sometimes also used to differentiate the original music heard and recorded versus a rerecording or cover.

Dvořák frequently employed rhythms and other aspects of the folk music of Moravia and his native Bohemia, following the Romantic-era nationalist example of his predecessor Bedřich Smetana. Dvořák's style has been described as ""the fullest recreation of a national idiom with that of the symphonic tradition, absorbing folk influences and finding effective ways of using them"".</p><p>Dvořák displayed his musical gifts at an early age, being an apt violin student from age six. The first public performances of his works were in Prague in 1872 and, with special success, in 1873, when he was 31 years old. Seeking recognition beyond the Prague area, he submitted a score of his First Symphony to a prize competition in Germany, but did not win, and the unreturned manuscript was lost until it was rediscovered many decades later. In 1874, he made a submission to the Austrian State Prize for Composition, including scores of two further symphonies and other works. Although Dvořák was not aware of it, Johannes Brahms was the leading member of the jury and was highly impressed. The prize was awarded to Dvořák in 1874 and again in 1876 and in 1877, when Brahms and the prominent critic Eduard Hanslick, also a member of the jury, made themselves known to him. Brahms recommended Dvořák to his publisher, Simrock, who soon afterward commissioned what became the <i>Slavonic Dances</i>, Op. 46. These were highly praised by the Berlin music critic Louis Ehlert in 1878, the sheet music (of the original piano 4-hands version) had excellent sales, and Dvořák's international reputation was launched at last.
</p><p>Dvořák's first piece of a religious nature, his setting of Stabat Mater, was premiered in Prague in 1880. It was very successfully performed in London in 1883, leading to many other performances in the United Kingdom and United States. In his career, Dvořák made nine invited visits to England, often conducting performances of his own works. His Seventh Symphony was written for London. Visiting Russia in March 1890, he conducted concerts of his own music in Moscow and Saint Petersburg. In 1891, Dvořák was appointed as a professor at the Prague Conservatory. In 1890–91, he wrote his <i>Dumky Trio</i>, one of his most successful chamber music pieces.
</p><p>In 1892, Dvořák moved to the United States and became the director of the National Conservatory of Music of America in New York City. The President of the National Conservatory of Music in America, Jeannette Thurber, offered Dvořák an annual salary of $15,000 – an incredibly lavish sum for the era (equivalent to $452,389 in 2021), twenty-five times what he was paid at the Prague Conservatory. While in the United States, Dvořák wrote his two most successful orchestral works: the Symphony <i>From the New World</i>, which spread his reputation worldwide, and his Cello Concerto, one of the most highly regarded of all cello concerti.
</p><p>In the summer of 1893, Dvořák moved from New York City to Spillville, Iowa, following the advice of his secretary, J.J. Kovarík. Dvořák had originally planned to come back to Bohemia, but Spillville was made up of mostly Czech immigrants, and thus he felt less homesick; Dvořák referred to it as his ""summer Vysoka."" This is where he wrote his most famous piece of chamber music, his String Quartet in F major, Op. 96, which was later nicknamed the <i>American Quartet</i>. Shortly after his time in Iowa, Dvořák extended his contract at the National Conservatory for another two years. However, the economic crisis of April 1893 resulted in Thurber's husband's loss of income, and directly influenced the National Conservatory's funding. Shortfalls in payment of his salary, along with increasing recognition in Europe and an onset of homesickness, led him to leave the United States and return to Bohemia in 1895.
</p><p>All of Dvořák's nine operas, except his first, have librettos in Czech and were intended to convey the Czech national spirit, as were some of his choral works. By far the most successful of the operas is <i>Rusalka</i>. Among his smaller works, the seventh <i>Humoresque</i> and the song ""Songs My Mother Taught Me"" are also widely performed and recorded. He has been described as ""arguably the most versatile... composer of his time"".</p><p>The Dvořák Prague International Music Festival is a major series of concerts held annually to celebrate Dvořák's life and works.</p>"

Lane rejoined the band and appeared on their seventh studio album – and first in twelve years – <i>Green Naugahyde</i> (2011). Following Lane's departure in 2013, Alexander returned to the band once again and Primus has since recorded two more albums with him – <i>Primus &amp; the Chocolate Factory with the Fungi Ensemble</i> (2014) and <i>The Desaturating Seven</i> (2017) – as well as the EP <i>Conspiranoid</i> (2022).
</p><p>Primus is characterized by its irreverent, quirky approach to music distinguished by Claypool's bass-first songwriting style and eccentric lyrical themes. In 1993, Robert Christgau remarked: ""[Primus is] quite possibly the strangest top-10 band ever, and good for them.""</p>

<p><b>The Chicks</b> (previously known as <b>Dixie Chicks</b>) are an American country music band from Dallas, Texas. Since 1995, the band has consisted of Natalie Maines (lead vocals, guitar) and sisters Martie Maguire (vocals, fiddle, mandolin, guitar) and Emily Strayer (vocals, guitar, banjo, Dobro). Maguire and Strayer, both née Erwin, founded the band in 1989 in Dallas, Texas, with bassist Laura Lynch and vocalist and guitarist Robin Lynn Macy. They performed bluegrass and country music, busking and touring the bluegrass festival circuits and small venues for six years without attracting a major label. In 1992, Macy left and Lynch became the lead vocalist. 
</p><p>Upon signing with Monument Records Nashville in 1997 and replacing Lynch with Maines, the Chicks achieved success with their albums <i>Wide Open Spaces</i> (1998) and <i>Fly</i> (1999). After Monument closed its Nashville branch, the Chicks moved to Columbia Records for <i>Home</i> (2002). These albums achieved multi-platinum sales in the United States, Canada, and Australia, along with several charting singles on the American <i>Billboard</i> Hot Country Songs charts. ""There's Your Trouble"", ""Wide Open Spaces"", ""You Were Mine"", ""Cowboy Take Me Away"", ""Without You"", and a cover of Bruce Robison's ""Travelin' Soldier"" reached number one. The Chicks also reached number one on the Adult Contemporary chart with their 2002 cover of Fleetwood Mac's ""Landslide"".
</p><p>Days before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Maines told a London audience that the Chicks did not endorse the war and were ashamed of US President George W. Bush being from Texas. The remarks triggered boycotts in the US and a backlash from fans. After a hiatus, the Chicks released <i>Taking the Long Way</i> in 2006, an album informed by the backlash. ""Not Ready to Make Nice"" became their biggest crossover single, reaching number four on the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100. After another hiatus, Maguire and Strayer released an album in 2009 as the Court Yard Hounds. The Chicks reunited to tour in the 2010s. In 2020, they removed ""Dixie"" from their name, citing negative connotations, and released their first album in 14 years, <i>Gaslighter.</i>
</p><p>The Chicks have won 13 Grammy Awards, including five in 2007 for <i>Taking the Long Way,</i> which received the Grammy Award for Album of the Year, and its single ""Not Ready to Make Nice"", which received the Grammy Award for Record of the Year and the Grammy Award for Song of the Year.

</p>

<p><b>Harry Edward Nilsson III</b> (June 15, 1941 – January 15, 1994), sometimes credited as <b>Nilsson</b>, was an American singer-songwriter who reached the peak of his commercial success in the early 1970s. His work is characterized by pioneering vocal overdub experiments, returns to the Great American Songbook, and fusions of Caribbean sounds. A tenor with a <span role=""math"">3<span>+</span><span>1</span>⁄<span>2</span></span> octave range, Nilsson was one of the few major pop-rock recording artists to achieve significant commercial success without ever performing major public concerts or undertaking regular tours.</p><p>Born in Brooklyn, Nilsson moved to Los Angeles as a teenager to escape his family's poor financial situation. While working as a computer programmer at a bank, he grew interested in musical composition and close-harmony singing, and was successful in having some of his songs recorded by various artists such as the Monkees. In 1967, he debuted on RCA Victor with the LP <i>Pandemonium Shadow Show</i>, followed by a variety of releases that included a collaboration with Randy Newman (<i>Nilsson Sings Newman</i>, 1970) and the original children's story <i>The Point!</i> (1971). He created the first remix album (<i>Aerial Pandemonium Ballet</i>, 1971) and recorded the first mashup song (""You Can't Do That"", 1967). His most commercially successful album, <i>Nilsson Schmilsson</i> (1971), produced the international top 10 singles ""Without You"" and ""Coconut"". His other top 10 hit, ""Everybody's Talkin'"" (1968), was featured prominently in the 1969 film <i>Midnight Cowboy</i>. A version of Nilsson's ""One"", released by Three Dog Night in 1969, also reached the U.S. top 10.</p><p>During a 1968 press conference, the Beatles were asked what their favorite American group was and answered ""Nilsson"". Sometimes called ""the American Beatle"", he soon formed close friendships with John Lennon and Ringo Starr. In the 1970s, Nilsson, Lennon and Starr were members of the Hollywood Vampires drinking club. They produced one collaborative album, <i>Pussy Cats</i> (1974). After 1977, Nilsson left RCA, and his record output diminished. In response to Lennon's 1980 murder, he took a hiatus from the music industry to campaign for gun control. For the rest of his life, he recorded only sporadically. In 1994, Nilsson died of a heart attack while in the midst of recording what became his last album, <i>Losst and Founnd</i> (2019).
</p><p>The craft of Nilsson's songs and defiant attitude he projected remain touchstones for later generations of indie rock musicians. Nilsson was voted No. 62 in <i>Rolling Stone</i><span>'</span>s 2015 list of the ""100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time"", where he was described as ""a pioneer of the Los Angeles studio sound"" and ""a crucial bridge"" between 1960s psychedelia and the 1970s singer-songwriter era. The RIAA certified <i>Nilsson Schmilsson</i> and <i>Son of Schmilsson</i> (1972) as gold records, indicating over 500,000 units sold each. He earned two Grammy Awards (for ""Everybody's Talkin'"" and ""Without You"").

</p><p>Funeral for a Friend's popularity rose in the United Kingdom with the release of their debut album, <i>Casually Dressed &amp; Deep in Conversation</i> (2003). Achieving both a gold certification and three top-twenty singles in their home country, <i>Casually Dressed &amp; Deep in Conversation</i> is often acclaimed as one of the landmark emo records of the 2000s. <i>Hours</i> (2005) featured a similar musical style to their debut, but also featured more melodic sensibilities, and <i>Tales Don't Tell Themselves</i> (2007) showed an evolution in Funeral for a Friend's musical style from that which defined their debut, as the group began to diverge from their use of screaming vocals and post-hardcore-influenced guitars, favoring a more melodic rock influence. These albums achieved gold and silver sales certificates respectively in the UK.
</p><p>Funeral for a Friend self-released their fourth album, <i>Memory and Humanity</i> (2008) through their short-lived record label <i>Join Us</i>, the album arguably being their most eclectic to date. Following this the band tied themselves to other independent labels for <i>Welcome Home Armageddon</i> (2011)  <i>Conduit</i> (2013), and <i>Chapter and Verse</i> (2015), which showed the band returning to the heavier style of their earlier work. In September 2015, they announced their break-up and final tour in 2016. On 21 May 2016, they played their last performance to a sold-out Forum in London.
</p><p>In October 2019, Funeral for a Friend reunited as a live band, initially for three benefit shows – two in Cardiff at the Cardiff University Student Union followed by one in London at Shepherd's Bush Empire.

</p>
<p><b>Buena Vista Social Club</b> is an ensemble of Cuban musicians established in 1996. The project was organized by World Circuit executive Nick Gold, produced by American guitarist Ry Cooder and directed by Juan de Marcos González. They named the group after the homonymous members' club in the Buenavista quarter of Havana, a popular music venue in the 1940s. To showcase the popular styles of the time, such as son, bolero and danzón, they recruited a dozen veteran musicians, some of whom had been retired for many years.
</p><p>The group's eponymous album was recorded in March 1996 and released in September 1997, quickly becoming an international success, which prompted the ensemble to perform with a full line-up in Amsterdam and New York in 1998. German director Wim Wenders captured the performance on film for a documentary—also called <i>Buena Vista Social Club</i>—that included interviews with the musicians conducted in Havana. Wenders' film was released in June 1999 to critical acclaim, receiving an Academy Award nomination for Best Documentary feature and winning numerous accolades including Best Documentary at the European Film Awards. This was followed up by a second documentary <i>Buena Vista Social Club: Adios</i> in 2017.
</p><p>The success of both the album and film sparked a revival of interest in traditional Cuban music and Latin American music in general. Some of the Cuban performers later released well-received solo albums and recorded collaborations with stars from different musical genres. The ""Buena Vista Social Club"" name became an umbrella term to describe these performances and releases, and has been likened to a brand label that encapsulates Cuba's ""musical golden age"" between the 1930s and 1950s. The new success was fleeting for the most recognizable artists in the ensemble: Compay Segundo, Rubén González, and Ibrahim Ferrer, who died at the ages of ninety-five, eighty-four, and seventy-eight respectively; Compay Segundo and González in 2003, then Ferrer in 2005.

They were formed in Grangemouth by Robin Guthrie (guitars, drum machine) and Will Heggie (bass), adding Elizabeth Fraser (vocals) in 1981 and replacing Heggie with multi-instrumentalist Simon Raymonde in 1983. The group earned critical praise for their ethereal, effects-laden sound and the soprano vocals of Fraser, whose lyrics often eschew any recognisable language. They pioneered the 1980s alternative subgenre of dream pop and helped define what would become shoegaze.</p><p>After signing with the British record label 4AD in 1982, they released their debut album <i>Garlands</i> later that year. The addition of Raymonde in 1983 solidified their final lineup, which produced their biggest hit in the UK, ""Pearly-Dewdrops' Drops"", peaking at No. 29 on the UK Singles Chart. In 1988, Cocteau Twins signed with Capitol Records in the United States, distributing their fifth album, <i>Blue Bell Knoll</i>, through a major label in the country. After the 1990 release of their most critically acclaimed album, <i>Heaven or Las Vegas</i>, the band left 4AD for Fontana Records, where they released their final two albums.
</p><p>After nearly 20 years together, the band disbanded in 1997 in part due to issues stemming from the disintegration of Fraser and Guthrie's romantic relationship. In 2005, the band announced that they would reunite to headline Coachella and embark on a world tour but the reunion was cancelled a month later after Fraser refused to perform on stage with Guthrie. In a 2021 interview, Raymonde confirmed that Cocteau Twins ""will never reform"".</p>"
