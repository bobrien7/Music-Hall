He has been described as one of popular music's most influential and innovative figures.</p><p>Born in Suffolk, Eno studied painting and experimental music at the art school of Ipswich Civic College in the mid 1960s, and then at Winchester School of Art.

Eno then released a number of solo pop albums beginning with <i>Here Come the Warm Jets</i> (1974) and, also in the mid-1970s, began exploring a minimalist direction on influential recordings such as <i>Discreet Music</i> (1975) and <i>Ambient 1: Music for Airports</i> (1978), coining the term ""ambient music"" with the latter.
</p><p>Alongside his solo work, Eno collaborated frequently with other musicians in the 1970s, including Robert Fripp, Harmonia, Cluster, Harold Budd, David Bowie, David Byrne and Judy Nylon. He also established himself as a sought-after producer, working on albums by John Cale, Jon Hassell, Laraaji, Talking Heads, Ultravox, and Devo, as well as the no wave compilation <i>No New York</i> (1978). In subsequent decades, Eno continued to record solo albums and produce for other artists, most prominently U2 and Coldplay, alongside work with artists such as Daniel Lanois, Laurie Anderson, Grace Jones, Slowdive, Karl Hyde, James, Kevin Shields, and Damon Albarn.
</p><p>Dating back to his time as a student, Eno has also worked in other media, including sound installations, film, and writing. In the mid-1970s, he co-developed Oblique Strategies, a deck of cards featuring aphorisms intended to spur creative thinking. From the 1970s onwards, Eno's installations have included the sails of the Sydney Opera House in 2009 and the Lovell Telescope at Jodrell Bank in 2016.

Throughout his career, he composed music for artists such as Paul Anka, Mina, Milva, Zucchero, and Andrea Bocelli. From 1960 to 1975, Morricone gained international fame for composing music for Westerns and—with an estimated 10 million copies sold—<i>Once Upon a Time in the West</i> is one of the best-selling scores worldwide. From 1966 to 1980, he was a main member of Il Gruppo, one of the first experimental composers collectives, and in 1969 he co-founded Forum Music Village, a prestigious recording studio. From the 1970s, Morricone excelled in Hollywood, composing for prolific American directors such as Don Siegel, Mike Nichols, Brian De Palma, Barry Levinson, Oliver Stone, Warren Beatty, John Carpenter, and Quentin Tarantino.

He continued to compose music for European productions, such as <i>Marco Polo</i>, <i>La piovra</i>, <i>Nostromo</i>, <i>Fateless</i>, <i>Karol</i>, and <i>En mai, fais ce qu'il te plait</i>. Morricone's music has been reused in television series, including <i>The Simpsons</i> and <i>The Sopranos</i>, and in many films, including <i>Inglourious Basterds</i> and <i>Django Unchained</i>. He also scored seven Westerns for Sergio Corbucci, Duccio Tessari's <i>Ringo</i> duology and Sergio Sollima's <i>The Big Gundown</i> and <i>Face to Face</i>. Morricone worked extensively for other film genres with directors such as Bernardo Bertolucci, Mauro Bolognini, Giuliano Montaldo, Roland Joffé, Roman Polanski, Henri Verneuil, Mario Bava, Lucio Fulci, Umberto Lenzi, and Pier Paolo Pasolini. His acclaimed soundtrack for <i>The Mission</i> (1986), was certified gold in the United States. The album <i>Yo-Yo Ma Plays Ennio Morricone</i> stayed for 105 weeks on the <i>Billboard</i> Top Classical Albums.</p><p>Morricone's best-known compositions include ""The Ecstasy of Gold"", ""Se telefonando"", ""Man with a Harmonica"", ""Here's to You"", the UK No. 2 single ""Chi Mai"", ""Gabriel's Oboe"", and ""E Più Ti Penso"". In 1971, he received a ""Targa d'Oro"" for worldwide sales of 22 million, and by 2016 Morricone had sold more than 70 million records worldwide. In 2007, he received the Academy Honorary Award ""for his magnificent and multifaceted contributions to the art of film music"". He was nominated for a further six Oscars, and in 2016, received his only competitive Academy Award for his score to Quentin Tarantino's film <i>The Hateful Eight</i>, at the time becoming the oldest person ever to win a competitive Oscar. His other achievements include three Grammy Awards, three Golden Globes, six BAFTAs, ten David di Donatello, eleven Nastro d'Argento, two European Film Awards, the Golden Lion Honorary Award, and the Polar Music Prize in 2010.

Dusty Springfield,Mary Isobel Catherine Bernadette O'Brien,1939|4|16,,1958–1995,,Dusty Springfield,"<p class=""mw-empty-elt"">

</p>
<p><b>Mary Isobel Catherine Bernadette O'Brien</b>  (16 April 1939 – 2 March 1999), better known by her stage name <b>Dusty Springfield</b>, was an English singer. With her distinctive mezzo-soprano sound, she was a popular singer of blue-eyed soul, pop and dramatic ballads, with French chanson, country, and jazz also in her repertoire. During her 1960s peak, she ranked among the most successful British female performers on both sides of the Atlantic. Her image – marked by a peroxide blonde bouffant/beehive hairstyle, heavy makeup (thick black eyeliner and eye shadow) and evening gowns, as well as stylised, gestural performances – made her an icon of the Swinging Sixties.</p><p>Born in West Hampstead in London into a family that enjoyed music, Springfield learned to sing at home. In 1958, she joined her first professional group, The Lana Sisters. Two years later, with her brother Tom Springfield and Tim Feild, Springfield formed the folk-pop vocal trio The Springfields. Two of their five 1961–63 Top 40 UK hits – ""Island of Dreams"" and ""Say I Won't Be There"" – reached no. 5 in the charts, both in the spring of 1963. In 1962 they also hit big in the United States with their cover of ""Silver Threads and Golden Needles"".
</p><p>Springfield's solo career began in late 1963 with the upbeat pop record ""I Only Want to Be with You"" — a  UK no. 4 hit, and the first of her six transatlantic Top 40 hits in the 1960s, along with ""Stay Awhile"" (1964), ""All I See Is You"" (1966), ""I'll Try Anything"" (1967) and the two releases now considered her signature songs: ""You Don't Have to Say You Love Me"" (1966 UK no. 1/US no. 4) and ""Son of a Preacher Man"" (1968/69 UK no. 9/US no. 10). The latter features on the 1968 pop and soul album <i>Dusty in Memphis</i>, one of Springfield's defining works. In March 2020, the US Library of Congress added it to the National Recording Registry, which preserves audio recordings considered to be ""culturally, historically or aesthetically significant"".
</p><p>Between 1964 and 1969, Springfield hit big in her native Britain with several singles which in America either failed to chart or were not released, among them ""I Just Don't Know What to Do with Myself"" (the biggest of her many Bacharach/David covers), ""In the Middle of Nowhere"", ""Some of Your Lovin'"", ""Goin' Back"" and ""I Close My Eyes and Count to Ten"". Conversely, she charted in the US (but not in the UK) with hits including ""Wishin' and Hopin' "", ""The Look of Love"" and ""The Windmills of Your Mind"".
</p><p>From 1971 to 1986, Springfield failed to register a hit from five album releases (aside from a minor 1979 UK chart appearance), but her 1987 collaboration with UK synthpop duo Pet Shop Boys, ""What Have I Done to Deserve This?"", took her back to the top of the charts, reaching no. 2 on both the UK singles chart and <i>Billboard</i>'s Hot 100. The collaboration also yielded two 1989 UK Top 20 hits: ""Nothing Has Been Proved"" and ""In Private"". In 1990, Springfield charted with ""Reputation"" – the last of 25 Top 40 UK hits in which she features.
</p><p>A fixture on British television, Springfield presented many episodes of the hip 1963–66 British TV music series <i>Ready Steady Go!</i> and, between 1966 and 69, hosted her own series on the BBC and ITV. In 1966, Springfield topped the popularity polls, including <i>Melody Maker</i><span>'</span>s Best International Vocalist, and was the first UK singer to top the <i>New Musical Express</i> readers' poll for Female Singer. She is a member of both the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame and the UK Music Hall of Fame. International polls have lauded Springfield as one of the finest female popular singers of all time.

</p><p>Born in Brooklyn but raised in Detroit, she first gained recognition at the age of 10, when she appeared on the television show <i>Star Search</i> and performed in concert alongside Gladys Knight. At the age of 12, Aaliyah signed with Jive Records and her uncle Barry Hankerson's Blackground Records. Hankerson introduced her to R. Kelly, who became her mentor, as well as lead songwriter and producer of her debut album, <i>Age Ain't Nothing but a Number</i>. The album sold three million copies in the United States and was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). After allegations of an illegal marriage with Kelly, Aaliyah ended her contract with Jive and signed with Atlantic Records.
</p><p>Aaliyah worked with record producers Timbaland and Missy Elliott for her second album, <i>One in a Million</i>, which sold three million copies in the United States and more than eight million copies worldwide. In 2000, Aaliyah appeared in her first film, <i>Romeo Must Die</i>. She contributed to the film's soundtrack, which spawned the single ""Try Again"". The song topped the <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 solely on airplay, making Aaliyah the first artist in <i>Billboard</i> history to achieve this goal. After completing <i>Romeo Must Die</i>, Aaliyah filmed her role in <i>Queen of the Damned</i>, and released, in 2001, her third and final album <i>Aaliyah</i>, which topped the <i>Billboard</i> 200.
</p><p>On August 25, 2001, Aaliyah died at the age of 22 in an airplane accident in the Bahamas, when the overloaded aircraft she was traveling in crashed shortly after takeoff, killing all nine on board. The pilot was later found to have traces of cocaine and alcohol in his body and was not qualified to fly the aircraft designated for the flight. Aaliyah's family later filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the aircraft's operator, Blackhawk International Airways, which was settled out of court. In the decades since her death, Aaliyah's music has continued to achieve commercial success, aided by several posthumous releases. She has sold 8.1 million albums in the US and an estimated 24 to 32 million albums worldwide. <i>Billboard</i> lists her as the tenth most successful female R&amp;B artist of the past 25 years, and the 27th most successful in history. Her accolades include three American Music Awards and two MTV VMAs, along with five Grammy Award nominations.

</p><p>Crosby influenced the development of the post World War II recording industry. After seeing a demonstration of a German broadcast quality reel-to-reel tape recorder brought to the United States by John T. Mullin, he invested $50,000 in the California electronics company Ampex to build copies. He then persuaded ABC to allow him to tape his shows. He became the first performer to prerecord his radio shows and master his commercial recordings onto magnetic tape. Crosby has been associated with the Christmas season since Irving Berlin's musical film <i>Holiday Inn</i>, in which he starred and sang songs such as ""White Christmas"" and ""Happy Holiday"". Through audio recordings, he produced his radio programs with the same directorial tools and craftsmanship (editing, retaking, rehearsal, time shifting) used in motion picture production, a practice that became the industry standard. In addition to his work with early audio tape recording, he helped finance the development of videotape, bought television stations, bred racehorses, and co-owned the Pittsburgh Pirates baseball team, during which time the team won two World Series (1960 and 1971).

</p>
<p><b>Roberta Joan</b> ""<b>Joni</b>"" <b>Mitchell</b>  (née <b>Anderson</b>; born November 7, 1943) is a Canadian-American musician, producer, and painter. Among the most influential singer-songwriters to emerge from the 1960s folk music circuit, Mitchell became known for her starkly personal lyrics and unconventional compositions, which grew to incorporate pop and jazz influences. She has received many accolades, including ten Grammy Awards and induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997. <i>Rolling Stone</i> called her ""one of the greatest songwriters ever"", and AllMusic has stated, ""When the dust settles, Joni Mitchell may stand as the most important and influential female recording artist of the late 20th century"".</p><p>Mitchell began singing in small nightclubs in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, and throughout western Canada, before moving on to the nightclubs of Toronto, Ontario. She moved to the United States and began touring in 1965. Some of her original songs (""Urge for Going"", ""Chelsea Morning"", ""Both Sides, Now"", ""The Circle Game"") were recorded by other folk singers, allowing her to sign with Reprise Records and record her debut album, <i>Song to a Seagull</i>, in 1968. Settling in Southern California, Mitchell helped define an era and a generation with popular songs like ""Big Yellow Taxi"" and ""Woodstock"". Her 1971 album <i>Blue</i> is often cited as one of the best albums of all time; it was rated the 30th best album ever made in <i>Rolling Stone</i><span>'</span>s 2003 list of the ""500 Greatest Albums of All Time"", rising to number 3 in the 2020 edition. In 2000, <i>The New York Times</i> chose <i>Blue</i> as one of the 25 albums that represented ""turning points and pinnacles in 20th-century popular music"". NPR ranked <i>Blue</i> number 1 on a 2017 list of Greatest Albums Made By Women.</p><p>Mitchell switched labels and began exploring more jazz-influenced ideas, by way of lush pop textures, on 1974's <i>Court and Spark</i>, which featured the radio hits ""Help Me"" and ""Free Man in Paris"" and became her best-selling album. Mitchell's vocal range began to shift from mezzo-soprano to more of a wide-ranging contralto around 1975. Her distinctive piano and open-tuned guitar compositions also grew more harmonically and rhythmically complex as she melded jazz with rock and roll, R&amp;B, classical music and non-Western beats. In the late 1970s, she began working with noted jazz musicians including Jaco Pastorius, Tom Scott, Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, and Pat Metheny as well as Charles Mingus, who asked her to collaborate on his final recordings. She later turned to pop and electronic music and engaged in political protest. She was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 44th Annual Grammy Awards in 2002.</p><p>Mitchell produced or co-produced most of her albums and designed most of her own album covers, describing herself as a ""painter derailed by circumstance"". A critic of the music industry, she quit touring and released her 17th and last album of original songs in 2007.  She would give occasional interviews and make appearances to speak on various causes over the next two decades, though the rupture of a brain aneurysm in 2015 led to a long period of recovery and therapy.  A series of retrospective compilations were released over the time period, culminating in the Joni Mitchell Archives, a project to publish much of Joni's unreleased material from her long career.  She returned to public appearances in 2021, accepting several awards in person, including a Kennedy Center Honor in 2021.  She performed live for the first time in 9 years, with an unannounced appearance at the June 2022 Newport Folk Festival, and is scheduled to perform a headline show on June 10, 2023.

</p><p>Nancy Sinatra began her career as a singer and actress in November 1957 with an appearance on her father's ABC-TV variety series, but initially achieved success only in Europe and Japan. In early 1966 she had a transatlantic number-one hit with ""These Boots Are Made for Walkin<span>'</span>"". A TV promo clip from the era features Sinatra in high boots, accompanied by colorfully dressed go-go dancers, in what is now considered an iconic Swinging Sixties look. The song was written by Lee Hazlewood, who wrote and produced most of her hits and sang with her on several duets. As with all of Sinatra's 1960s hits, ""Boots"" featured Billy Strange as arranger and conductor.
</p><p>Between early 1966 and early 1968, Sinatra charted on <i>Billboard'</i>s Hot 100 with 14 titles, ten of which reached the Top 40. In addition to ""These Boots Are Made for Walkin<span>'</span>"", defining recordings during this period include ""Sugar Town"", ""Love Eyes"", the transatlantic 1967 number one ""Somethin' Stupid"" (a duet with her father), two versions of the title song from the James Bond film <i>You Only Live Twice</i> (1967), several collaborations with Lee Hazlewood – including ""Summer Wine"", ""Jackson"", ""Lady Bird"" and ""Some Velvet Morning"" – and a non-single 1966 cover of the Cher hit ""Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)"", which features in the opening credits of Quentin Tarantino's 2003 film <i>Kill Bill Volume 1</i>. In 1971 Sinatra and Hazlewood achieved their first collaborative success in the UK singles chart with the no. 2 hit ""Did You Ever?"", and the 2005 UK no. 3 hit by Audio Bullys, ""Shot You Down"", sampled Sinatra's version of ""Bang Bang"".
</p><p>Between 1964 and 1968 Sinatra appeared in several feature films, co-starring with Peter Fonda in Roger Corman's biker-gang movie <i>The Wild Angels</i> (1966) and alongside Elvis Presley in the musical drama <i>Speedway</i> (1968). Frank and Nancy Sinatra played a fictional father and daughter in the 1965 comedy <i>Marriage on the Rocks</i>.

<p><b>Samuel Cook</b> (January 22, 1931 – December 11, 1964), known professionally as <b>Sam Cooke</b>, was an American singer and songwriter. Considered to be a pioneer and one of the most influential soul artists of all time, Cooke is commonly referred to as the ""King of Soul"" for his distinctive vocals, notable contributions to the genre and significance in popular music.</p><p>Cooke was born in Clarksdale, Mississippi, and later relocated to Chicago with his family at a young age, where he began singing as a child and joined the Soul Stirrers as lead singer in the 1950s. Going solo in 1957, Cooke released a string of hit songs, including ""You Send Me"", ""A Change Is Gonna Come"", ""Cupid"", ""Wonderful World"", ""Chain Gang"", ""Twistin' the Night Away"", ""Bring It On Home to Me"", and ""Good Times"". During his eight-year career, Cooke released 29 singles that charted in the Top 40 of the <i>Billboard</i> Pop Singles chart, as well as 20 singles in the Top Ten of <i>Billboard</i><span>'s</span> Black Singles chart.
</p><p>In 1964, Cooke was shot and killed by the manager of a motel in Los Angeles. After an inquest and investigation, the courts ruled Cooke's death to be a justifiable homicide. His family has since questioned the circumstances of his death.
</p><p>Cooke's pioneering contributions to soul music contributed to the rise of Aretha Franklin, Bobby Womack, Al Green, Curtis Mayfield, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, and Billy Preston, and popularized the work of Otis Redding and James Brown. AllMusic biographer Bruce Eder wrote that Cooke was ""the inventor of soul music"", and possessed ""an incredible natural singing voice and a smooth, effortless delivery that has never been surpassed"".</p><p>Cooke was also a central part of the civil rights movement, using his influence and popularity with the White and Black populations to fight for the cause. He was friends with boxer Muhammad Ali, activist Malcolm X and football player Jim Brown, who together campaigned for racial equality.

Пётр Ильич Чайковский,,1840|05|07,Votkinsk,,,Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky,"<link rel=""mw-deduplicated-inline-style"" href=""mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096"">
<p class=""mw-empty-elt"">
</p>
<p><b>Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky</b> (<span></span> <i title=""English pronunciation respelling"">chy-<span>KOF</span>-skee</i>; 7 May 1840 – 6 November 1893) was a Russian composer of the Romantic period. He was the first Russian composer whose music would make a lasting impression internationally. He wrote some of the most popular concert and theatrical music in the current classical repertoire, including the ballets <i>Swan Lake</i> and <i>The Nutcracker</i>, the <i>1812 Overture</i>, his First Piano Concerto, Violin Concerto, the <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> Overture-Fantasy, several symphonies, and the opera <i>Eugene Onegin</i>.
</p><p>Although musically precocious, Tchaikovsky was educated for a career as a civil servant as there was little opportunity for a musical career in Russia at the time and no system of public music education. When an opportunity for such an education arose, he entered the nascent Saint Petersburg Conservatory, from which he graduated in 1865. The formal Western-oriented teaching that he received there set him apart from composers of the contemporary nationalist movement embodied by the Russian composers of The Five with whom his professional relationship was mixed.
</p><p>Tchaikovsky's training set him on a path to reconcile what he had learned with the native musical practices to which he had been exposed from childhood. From that reconciliation, he forged a personal but unmistakably Russian style. The principles that governed melody, harmony and other fundamentals of Russian music ran completely counter to those that governed Western European music, which seemed to defeat the potential for using Russian music in large-scale Western composition or for forming a composite style, and it caused personal antipathies that dented Tchaikovsky's self-confidence. Russian culture exhibited a split personality, with its native and adopted elements having drifted apart increasingly since the time of Peter the Great. That resulted in uncertainty among the intelligentsia about the country's national identity, an ambiguity mirrored in Tchaikovsky's career.
</p><p>Despite his many popular successes, Tchaikovsky's life was punctuated by personal crises and depression. Contributory factors included his early separation from his mother for boarding school followed by his mother's early death, the death of his close friend and colleague Nikolai Rubinstein, his failed marriage with Antonina Miliukova, and the collapse of his 13-year association with the wealthy patroness Nadezhda von Meck. His homosexuality, which he kept private, has traditionally also been considered a major factor though some scholars have downplayed its importance. Tchaikovsky's dedication of his Sixth symphony to his nephew Vladimir “Bob” Davydov (13 at the time) and his feelings expressed about Davydov in letters to others, especially following Davydov's suicide, have been cited as evidence for a romantic love between the two. Tchaikovsky's sudden death at the age of 53 is generally ascribed to cholera, but there is an ongoing debate as to whether cholera was indeed the cause and whether the death was accidental or intentional.
</p><p>While his music has remained popular among audiences, critical opinions were initially mixed. Some Russians did not feel it was sufficiently representative of native musical values and expressed suspicion that Europeans accepted the music for its Western elements. In an apparent reinforcement of the latter claim, some Europeans lauded Tchaikovsky for offering music more substantive than base exoticism and said he transcended stereotypes of Russian classical music. Others dismissed Tchaikovsky's music as ""lacking in elevated thought"" and derided its formal workings as deficient because they did not stringently follow Western principles.

Willie Nelson,Willie Hugh Nelson,1933|4|29,Abbott,1956–present,Vocals|guitar,Willie Nelson,"<p class=""mw-empty-elt"">


</p>
<p><b>Willie Hugh Nelson</b> (born April 29, 1933) is an American singer, songwriter, musician, political activist and actor. He was one of the main figures of outlaw country, a subgenre of country music that developed in the late 1960s as a reaction to the conservative restrictions of the Nashville sound. The critical success of his album <i>Shotgun Willie</i> (1973), combined with the critical and commercial success of <i>Red Headed Stranger</i> (1975) and <i>Stardust</i> (1978), made Nelson one of the most recognized artists in country music. Nelson has acted in over 30 films, co-authored several books, and has been involved in activism for the use of biofuels and the legalization of marijuana.
</p><p>Born during the Great Depression and raised by his grandparents, Nelson wrote his first song at age seven and joined his first band at ten. During high school, he toured locally with the Bohemian Polka as their lead singer and guitar player. After graduating from high school in 1950, he joined the U.S. Air Force but was later discharged due to back problems. After his return, Nelson attended Baylor University for two years but dropped out because he was succeeding in music. He worked as a disc jockey at radio stations in his native Texas, and in several radio stations in the Pacific Northwest, all the while working as a singer and songwriter throughout the late 1950s. During that time, he wrote songs that would become country standards, including ""Funny How Time Slips Away"", ""Hello Walls"", ""Pretty Paper"", and ""Crazy"". In 1960 he moved to Nashville, Tennessee, and later signed a publishing contract with Pamper Music which allowed him to join Ray Price's band as a bassist. In 1962, he recorded his first album, <i>...And Then I Wrote</i>. Due to this success, Nelson signed in 1964 with RCA Victor and joined the Grand Ole Opry the following year. After mid-chart hits in the late 1960s and the early 1970s, Nelson grew weary of the corporate Nashville music scene, and in 1972 he moved to Austin, Texas. The ongoing music scene of Austin motivated Nelson to return to performing, appearing frequently at the Armadillo World Headquarters.
</p><p>In 1973, after signing with Atlantic Records, Nelson turned to outlaw country, including albums such as <i>Shotgun Willie</i> and <i>Phases and Stages</i>. In 1975, he switched to Columbia Records, where he recorded the critically acclaimed album <i>Red Headed Stranger</i>. The same year, he recorded another outlaw country album, <i>Wanted! The Outlaws</i>, along with Waylon Jennings, Jessi Colter, and Tompall Glaser. During the mid-1980s, while creating hit albums like <i>Honeysuckle Rose</i> and recording hit songs like ""On the Road Again"", ""To All the Girls I've Loved Before"", and ""Pancho and Lefty"", he joined the country supergroup The Highwaymen, along with fellow singers Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, and Kris Kristofferson. In 1985, he helped organize the first Farm Aid concert to benefit American farmers; the concerts have been held annually ever since and Nelson has been a fixture, appearing at every one.
</p><p>In 1990, Nelson's assets were seized by the Internal Revenue Service, which claimed that he owed $32<span> </span>million. The difficulty of paying his outstanding debt was aggravated by weak investments he had made during the 1980s. In 1992, Nelson released <i>The IRS Tapes: Who'll Buy My Memories?</i>; the profits of the double album—destined to the IRS—and the auction of Nelson's assets cleared his debt. During the 1990s and 2000s, Nelson continued touring extensively, and released albums every year. Reviews ranged from positive to mixed. He explored genres such as reggae, blues, jazz, and folk.
</p><p>Nelson made his first movie appearance in the 1979 film <i>The Electric Horseman</i>, followed by other appearances in movies and on television. Nelson is a major liberal activist and the co-chair of the advisory board of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML), which is in favor of marijuana legalization. On the environmental front, Nelson owns the biodiesel brand Willie Nelson Biodiesel, whose product is made from vegetable oil. Nelson is also the honorary chairman of the advisory board of the Texas Music Project, the official music charity of the state of Texas.

<p><b>Ronald James Padavona</b> (July 10, 1942 – May 16, 2010), known professionally as <b>Ronnie James Dio</b>, was an American heavy metal singer. He fronted and founded numerous bands throughout his career, including Elf, Rainbow, Black Sabbath, Dio and Heaven &amp; Hell.
</p><p>Though his parents were from Cortland, New York, Dio was born in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, where his family resided for his father's service in the U.S. Army during World War II. The family returned to Cortland when Dio was very young, and he lived there until from graduating high school in 1960. Dio's music career began in 1957 as part of the Vegas Kings (later Ronnie and the Rumblers). In 1967, he formed the rock band Elf, which became a regular opening act for Deep Purple. In 1975, Deep Purple guitarist Ritchie Blackmore founded the band Rainbow and hired Dio to be the lead singer; during his tenure, the band released three studio albums. Dio quickly emerged as one of heavy rock's pre-eminent vocalists. In 1979, Dio replaced Ozzy Osbourne as Black Sabbath's lead singer and appeared on three studio albums with the band, all three of which were met with success: <i>Heaven &amp; Hell</i> (1980), <i>Mob Rules</i> (1981) and <i>Dehumanizer</i> (1992). In 1982, he left to form the band Dio, which itself had two albums certified platinum by the RIAA. In 2006, he founded the band Heaven &amp; Hell with ex-bandmate Tony Iommi. In November 2009, Dio was diagnosed with stomach cancer and died of the disease six months later.
</p><p>Dio is regarded as one of the greatest and most influential heavy metal vocalists of all time. He is known for popularizing the ""devil horns"" hand gesture in metal culture and his medieval-themed song lyrics. According to a version provided by the singer himself, the act derives directly from the classic Italian apotropaic gesture, which his grandmother often displayed. Dio had a powerful, versatile vocal range and was capable of singing both hard rock and lighter ballads. He was awarded the ""Metal Guru Award"" by <i>Classic Rock Magazine</i> in 2006. He was also named the ""Best Metal Singer"" at the <i>Revolver</i> Golden Gods Awards in 2010 and ranked as the genre's best vocalist in 2013 by music journalist Sacha Jenkins.</p>",

<p><b>Edward Kennedy</b> ""<b>Duke</b>"" <b>Ellington</b> (April 29, 1899 – May 24, 1974) was an American jazz pianist, composer, and leader of his eponymous jazz orchestra from 1923 through the rest of his life.</p><p>Born and raised in Washington, D.C., Ellington was based in New York City from the mid-1920s and gained a national profile through his orchestra's appearances at the Cotton Club in Harlem. A master at writing miniatures for the three-minute 78 rpm recording format, Ellington wrote or collaborated on more than one thousand compositions; his extensive body of work is the largest recorded personal jazz legacy, and many of his pieces have become standards. He also recorded songs written by his bandsmen, such as Juan Tizol's ""Caravan"", which brought a Spanish tinge to big band jazz.
</p><p>At the end of the 1930s, Ellington began a nearly thirty-year collaboration with composer-arranger-pianist Billy Strayhorn, whom he called his writing and arranging companion. With Strayhorn, he composed multiple extended compositions, or suites, as well as many short pieces. For a few years at the beginning of Strayhorn's involvement, Ellington's orchestra featured bassist Jimmy Blanton and tenor saxophonist Ben Webster and reached a creative peak. Some years later following a low-profile period (Hodges temporarily left), an appearance by Ellington and his orchestra at the Newport Jazz Festival in July 1956 led to a major revival and regular world tours. Ellington recorded for most American record companies of his era, performed in and scored several films, and composed a handful of stage musicals.
</p><p>Although a pivotal figure in the history of jazz, in the opinion of Gunther Schuller and Barry Kernfeld, ""the most significant composer of the genre"", Ellington himself embraced the phrase ""beyond category"", considering it a liberating principle, and referring to his music as part of the more general category of American Music. Ellington was known for his inventive use of the orchestra, or big band, as well as for his eloquence and charisma. He was awarded a posthumous Pulitzer Prize Special Award for music in 1999.</p>

<p class=""mw-empty-elt"">

</p>
<p><b>Charles Hardin Holley</b> (September 7, 1936 – February 3, 1959), known as <b>Buddy Holly</b>, was an American singer and songwriter who was a central and pioneering figure of mid-1950s rock and roll. He was born to a musical family in Lubbock, Texas during the Great Depression, and learned to play guitar and sing alongside his siblings. His style was influenced by gospel music, country music, and rhythm and blues acts, which he performed in Lubbock with his friends from high school.
</p><p>He made his first appearance on local television in 1952, and the following year he formed the group ""Buddy and Bob"" with his friend Bob Montgomery. In 1955, after opening for Elvis Presley, he decided to pursue a career in music. He opened for Presley three times that year; his band's style shifted from country and western to entirely rock and roll. In October that year, when he opened for Bill Haley &amp; His Comets, he was spotted by Nashville scout Eddie Crandall, who helped him get a contract with Decca Records.
</p><p>Holly's recording sessions at Decca were produced by Owen Bradley, who had become famous for producing orchestrated country hits for stars like Patsy Cline. Unhappy with Bradley's musical style and control in the studio, Holly went to producer Norman Petty in Clovis, New Mexico, and recorded a demo of ""That'll Be the Day"", among other songs. Petty became the band's manager and sent the demo to Brunswick Records, which released it as a single credited to ""The Crickets"", which became the name of Holly's band. In September 1957, as the band toured, ""That'll Be the Day"" topped the US and UK singles charts. Its success was followed in October by another major hit, ""Peggy Sue"".
</p><p>The album <i>The ""Chirping"" Crickets</i>, released in November 1957, reached number five on the UK Albums Chart. Holly made his second appearance on <i>The Ed Sullivan Show</i> in January 1958 and soon after toured Australia and then the UK. In early 1959, he assembled a new band, consisting of future country music star Waylon Jennings (bass), famed session musician Tommy Allsup (guitar), and Carl Bunch (drums), and embarked on a tour of the midwestern US. After a show in Clear Lake, Iowa, he chartered an airplane to travel to his next show in Moorhead, Minnesota. Soon after takeoff, the plane crashed, killing Holly, Ritchie Valens, The Big Bopper, and pilot Roger Peterson in a tragedy later referred to by Don McLean as ""The Day the Music Died"" in his song ""American Pie"".
</p><p>During his short career, Holly wrote and recorded many songs. He is often regarded as the artist who defined the traditional rock-and-roll lineup of two guitars, bass, and drums. He was a major influence on later popular music artists, including Bob Dylan, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton, The Hollies, Elvis Costello, Dave Edmunds, Marshall Crenshaw, and Elton John. He was among the first artists inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, in 1986. <i>Rolling Stone</i> magazine ranked him number 13 in its list of ""100 Greatest Artists"" in 2010.

The younger sister of singer and actress Jessica Simpson, she began her career as a back-up dancer for her sister and appeared in television commercials at the age of 15. She later pursued a career as an actress and had a main role on the family drama <i>7th Heaven.</i> She appeared on the reality show <i>Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica</i>, broadcast on MTV between 2003 and 2005, which focused on Ashlee's older sister Jessica and Jessica's then-husband Nick Lachey. While working on her debut studio album, Simpson became the star of a spin-off reality series, <i>The Ashlee Simpson Show</i>, which was broadcast on MTV between 2004 and 2005. Like her sister before her, Simpson became the center of considerable media attention.
</p><p>Her breakout came with her debut single, ""Pieces of Me"", which was released in 2004, became a top-five hit in the United States and topped the <i>Billboard</i> Mainstream Top 40 chart based on radio airplay. The success of the single and her reality show helped propel her debut album, <i>Autobiography,</i> also released in 2004, to the top of the <i>Billboard</i> 200 albums chart. The project sold over five million copies worldwide, making it her most successful album to date. Simpson had a leading role in the film <i>Undiscovered</i> (2005), which became a critical and commercial flop. The failure of the film, along with multiple critically panned performances, led to media scrutiny. Despite that, Simpson's second studio album, <i>I Am Me</i> (2005), debuted atop the <i>Billboard</i> 200, becoming her second album to do so. The album went on to receive a platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).
</p><p>Following her appearance as Roxie Hart in the West End production of <i>Chicago,</i> Simpson announced that she had begun working on her third studio album.

The effort reached number 4 on the <i>Billboard</i> 200. The following year, Simpson joined the main cast of the <i>Melrose Place</i> revamp, which was met with harsh critical reception. Later that year, she made her Broadway debut reprising her role as Roxie Hart in <i>Chicago</i> on Broadway.

<p><b>Donovan Phillips Leitch</b> (born 10 May 1946), known mononymously as <b>Donovan</b>, is a Scottish musician, songwriter, and record producer. He developed an eclectic and distinctive style that blended folk, jazz, pop, psychedelic rock and world music (notably calypso). He has lived in Scotland, Hertfordshire (England), London, California, and—since at least 2008—in County Cork, Ireland, with his family. Emerging from the British folk scene, Donovan reached fame in the United Kingdom in early 1965 with live performances on the pop TV series <i>Ready Steady Go!</i>.
</p><p>Having signed with Pye Records in 1965, he recorded singles and two albums in the folk vein for Hickory Records, after which he signed to CBS/Epic in the US—the first signing by the company's new vice-president Clive Davis—and became more successful internationally. He began a long and successful collaboration with leading British independent record producer Mickie Most, scoring multiple hit singles and albums in the UK, US, and other countries.</p><p>He emerged onto the scene in 1965 with three UK hit singles: ""Catch the Wind"", ""Colours"" and ""Universal Soldier"", the last written by Buffy Sainte-Marie. In September 1966, ""Sunshine Superman"" topped America's <i>Billboard</i> Hot 100 chart for one week and went to No. 2 in Britain, followed by ""Mellow Yellow"" at US No. 2 in December 1966, then 1968's ""Hurdy Gurdy Man"" in the top 5 in both countries, and then ""Atlantis"", which reached US No. 7 in May 1969. The compilation <i>Donovan's Greatest Hits</i> was released in March 1969 and peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard 200.</p><p>He became a friend of pop and folk musicians including Joan Baez, Brian Jones, and the Beatles. He taught John Lennon a finger-picking guitar style in 1968 that Lennon employed in ""Dear Prudence"", ""Julia"", ""Happiness Is a Warm Gun"", and other songs. His backing musicians included the Jeff Beck Group, and John Bonham, Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones, who later rose to fame as members of Led Zeppelin. Donovan's commercial fortunes waned after parting with Most in 1969, and he left the industry for a time.
</p><p>Donovan continued to perform and record sporadically in the 1970s and 1980s.  His musical style and hippie image were scorned by critics, especially after the rise of punk rock. His performing and recording became sporadic until a revival in the 1990s with the emergence of Britain's rave scene. He recorded the 1996 album <i>Sutras</i> with producer Rick Rubin and in 2004 made a new album, <i>Beat Cafe</i>. Donovan was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012 and the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2014.

</p>
<p><b>Stephen Ray Vaughan</b> (October 3, 1954 – August 27, 1990) was an American musician, best known as the guitarist and frontman of the blues rock trio Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble. Although his mainstream career spanned only seven years, he is regarded as one of the most influential musicians in the history of blues music, and one of the greatest guitarists of all time. He was the younger brother of guitarist Jimmie Vaughan.
</p><p>Born and raised in Dallas, Vaughan began playing guitar at age seven, initially inspired by his elder brother, Jimmie Vaughan. In 1972, he dropped out of high school and moved to Austin, where he began to gain a following after playing gigs on the local club circuit. Vaughan joined forces with Tommy Shannon on bass and Chris Layton on drums as Double Trouble in 1978 and established it as part of the Austin music scene; it soon became one of the most popular acts in Texas. He performed at the Montreux Jazz Festival in 1982, where David Bowie saw him play. Bowie contacted him for a studio gig that resulted in Vaughan playing blues guitar on the album <i>Let's Dance</i> (1983), before being discovered by John Hammond who interested major label Epic Records in signing Vaughan and his band to a record deal. Within months, they achieved mainstream success for the critically acclaimed debut album <i>Texas Flood</i>. With a series of successful network television appearances and extensive concert tours, Vaughan became the leading figure in the blues revival of the 1980s.
Playing his guitar behind his back or plucking the strings with his teeth as Jimi Hendrix did, he earned fame in Europe, which later resulted in breakthroughs for guitar players like Robert Cray, Jeff Healey, Robben Ford, and Walter Trout, amongst others.
</p><p>During the majority of his life, Vaughan struggled with alcoholism and drug addiction. He also struggled with the personal and professional pressures of fame and his marriage to Lenora ""Lenny"" Bailey. He successfully completed rehabilitation and began touring again with Double Trouble in November 1986. His fourth and final studio album <i>In Step</i> reached number 33 in the United States in 1989; it was one of Vaughan's most critically and commercially successful releases and included his only number-one hit, ""Crossfire"". He became one of the world's most highly demanded blues performers, and he headlined Madison Square Garden in 1989 and the Beale Street Music Festival in 1990.
</p><p>On August 27, 1990, Vaughan and four others were killed in a helicopter crash in East Troy, Wisconsin, after performing with Double Trouble at Alpine Valley Music Theatre. An investigation concluded that the cause of the accident was pilot error and Vaughan's family later filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Omniflight Helicopters which was settled out of court. Vaughan's music continued to achieve commercial success with several posthumous releases and has sold over 15 million albums in the United States alone. In 2003, David Fricke of <i>Rolling Stone</i> ranked him the seventh greatest guitarist of all time. Vaughan was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2015, along with Double Trouble bandmates Chris Layton, Tommy Shannon, and Reese Wynans.

In 1946, he recorded his first records for Columbia Records and then for Aristocrat Records, a newly formed label run by the brothers Leonard and Phil Chess.
</p><p>In the early 1950s, Muddy Waters and his band—Little Walter Jacobs on harmonica, Jimmy Rogers on guitar, Elga Edmonds (also known as Elgin Evans) on drums and Otis Spann on piano—recorded several blues classics, some with the bassist and songwriter Willie Dixon. These songs included ""Hoochie Coochie Man,"" ""I Just Want to Make Love to You"" and ""I'm Ready"". In 1958, he traveled to England, laying the foundations of the resurgence of interest in the  blues there. His performance at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1960 was recorded and released as his first live album, <i>At Newport 1960</i>.

<p><b>George Frideric</b> (or <b>Frederick</b>) <b>Handel</b> (<span></span>; baptised <span title=""German-language text""><span lang=""de""><b>Georg Friedrich Händel</b></span></span>, <small>German: </small><span title=""Representation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)"" lang=""de-Latn-fonipa"">[ˈɡeːɔʁk ˈfʁiːdʁɪç ˈhɛndl̩]</span> <span></span>; 23 February 1685 – 14 April 1759) was a German-British Baroque composer well known for his operas, oratorios, anthems, concerti grossi, and organ concertos. Handel received his training in Halle and worked as a composer in Hamburg and Italy before settling in London in 1712, where he spent the bulk of his career and became a naturalised British subject in 1727. He was strongly influenced both by the middle-German polyphonic choral tradition and by composers of the Italian Baroque. In turn, Handel's music forms one of the peaks of the ""high baroque"" style, bringing Italian opera to its highest development, creating the genres of English oratorio and organ concerto, and introducing a new style into English church music. He is consistently recognized as one of the greatest composers of his age.</p><p>Handel started three commercial opera companies to supply the English nobility with Italian opera. In 1737, he had a physical breakdown, changed direction creatively, and addressed the middle class and made a transition to English choral works. After his success with <i>Messiah</i> (1742), he never composed an Italian opera again. His orchestral <i>Water Music</i> and <i>Music for the Royal Fireworks</i> remain steadfastly popular. One of his four coronation anthems, <i>Zadok the Priest</i>, has been performed at every British coronation since 1727. Almost blind, he died in 1759, a respected and rich man, and was given a state funeral at Westminster Abbey.
</p><p>Handel composed more than forty opere serie over a period of more than thirty years. Since the late 1960s, interest in Handel's music has grown. The musicologist Winton Dean wrote that ""Handel was not only a great composer; he was a dramatic genius of the first order."" His music was admired by Classical-era composers, including Mozart, Haydn and Beethoven.

Born in New York City and raised on Long Island, Lohan was signed to Ford Models at the age of three. Having appeared as a regular on the television soap opera <i>Another World</i> at age 10, her breakthrough came in the Walt Disney Pictures film <i>The Parent Trap</i> (1998). The film's success led to appearances in the television films <i>Life-Size</i> (2000) and <i>Get a Clue</i> (2002), and the big-screen productions <i>Freaky Friday</i> (2003) and <i>Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen</i> (2004). Lohan's early work won her childhood stardom, while the teen comedy sleeper hit <i>Mean Girls</i> (2004) affirmed her status as a teen idol and established her as a Hollywood leading actress. 
</p><p>Lohan became known as a triple threat after signing with Casablanca Records and releasing two studio albums, the platinum-certified <i>Speak</i> (2004) and gold-certified <i>A Little More Personal (Raw)</i> (2005). She also starred in the comedies <i>Herbie: Fully Loaded</i> (2005) and <i>Just My Luck</i> (2006). In order to showcase her range, Lohan began choosing roles in independent films such as <i>A Prairie Home Companion</i> and <i>Bobby</i> (both 2006) and <i>Chapter 27</i> (2007). Her reported behavior during the filming of the dramedy <i>Georgia Rule</i> in 2006 marked the start of a series of personal struggles that would plague her life and career for most of the next decade. She became a fixture in the tabloid press for her frequent legal issues, court appearances and stints in rehabilitation facilities. This period saw her lose several roles, negatively impacting her career and public image. In an attempt to return to acting, she appeared in <i>Liz &amp; Dick</i> (2012) and <i>The Canyons</i> (2013), but were both met with negative reviews.
</p><p>In 2013, under the guidance of Oprah Winfrey, Lohan filmed the docu-series <i>Lindsay</i> (2014), which depicted her returning to work.

</p>
<p><b>Frank Vincent Zappa</b> (December 21, 1940 – December 4, 1993) was an American musician, composer, and bandleader. His work is characterized by nonconformity, free-form improvisation, sound experiments, musical virtuosity and satire of American culture. In a career spanning more than 30 years, Zappa composed rock, pop, jazz, jazz fusion, orchestral  and <i>musique concrète</i> works, and produced almost all of the 60-plus albums that he released with his band the Mothers of Invention and as a solo artist. Zappa also directed feature-length films and music videos, and designed album covers. He is considered one of the most innovative and stylistically diverse musicians of his generation.</p><p>As a self-taught composer and performer, Zappa had diverse musical influences that led him to create music that was sometimes difficult to categorize. While in his teens, he acquired a taste for 20th-century classical modernism, African-American rhythm and blues, and doo-wop music. He began writing classical music in high school, while at the same time playing drums in rhythm and blues bands, later switching to electric guitar. His debut studio album with the Mothers of Invention, <i>Freak Out!</i> (1966), combined songs in conventional rock and roll format with collective improvisations and studio-generated sound collages. He continued this eclectic and experimental approach whether the fundamental format was rock, jazz, or classical.
</p><p>Zappa's output is unified by a conceptual continuity he termed ""Project/Object"", with numerous musical phrases, ideas, and characters reappearing across his albums. His lyrics reflected his iconoclastic views of established social and political processes, structures and movements, often humorously so, and he has been described as the ""godfather"" of comedy rock. He was a strident critic of mainstream education and organized religion, and a forthright and passionate advocate for freedom of speech, self-education, political participation and the abolition of censorship. Unlike many other rock musicians of his generation, he disapproved of recreational drug use, but supported decriminalization and regulation.
</p><p>Zappa was a highly productive and prolific artist with a controversial critical standing; supporters of his music admired its compositional complexity, while detractors found it lacking emotional depth. He had greater commercial success outside the US, particularly in Europe. Though he worked as an independent artist, Zappa mostly relied on distribution agreements he had negotiated with the major record labels. He remains a major influence on musicians and composers. His many honors include his posthumous 1995 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the 1997 Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.
